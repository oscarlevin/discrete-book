            <p>This is the introduction.  It comes before the other sections.  For example it comes before <xref ref="sec-background" autoname="yes"/>.</p>

            <title>Background</title>
            <p>The first thing you should know about this sentence is that it is false.  Which is a strange thing for a sentence to claim about itself, but then of course it is self referenctial, so what do you expect.</p>

            <p>A second paragraph is also possible, but would not change the fact that this whole seciton is rather rediculous.</p>

        <section xml:id="sec-examples">
            <title>A few examples.</title>
            <example>
                <p>This is the first example.  It doesn't have a title.</p>
            </example>

            <example xml:id="ex-2">
                <title>Another example</title>
                <p>Here is another example.  This one does have a title.</p>
                <solution>This is the solution to the second exercise.</solution>
            </example>

            <exercise>
            <statement><p>This is an exercise which asks you to compute something.  It is really just an excuse to play with math mode.</p>

                <p>For example, we could ask, what is the quadratic equation?</p></statement>
                <solution><p><m>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</m></p></solution>
            </exercise>

            <example xml:id="ex-3">
                <p>What is the number of this example?</p>
                <hint>It's not the first or the second, and the fourth is right out of the question.</hint>
                <solution>3</solution>
                <solution><p>If you count from the top, you will realize this is the third example.  Don't confuse this with <xref ref="ex-2" />.</p></solution>
            </example>

        <introduction>
        <title>Another introduction</title>
         <p>Can we really have two introductions?</p>
        </introduction>


        <p>This is a paragraph without a section.  Where will it show up?</p>
