Why is this true? \({n \choose k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(k\) things from \(n\) choices. On the other hand, \({n \choose n-k}\) counts the number of ways to select \(n-k\) things from \(n\) choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the \(n-k\) things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose \(n-k\) things to exclude from \(n\) choices. Clearly this is \({n \choose n-k}\) as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude \(n-k\) things, then you are including the other \(k\) things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.

Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick \(k\) toppings from a list of \(n\) choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply \({n \choose k}\). Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly \(k\) toppings, you need to pick \(n-k\) toppings to not put on the pizza. You have \({n \choose n-k}\) choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with \(k\) toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with \(k\) toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: \({n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}\).

You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings, subsets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: \({n \choose k}\) counts the number of bit strings of length \(n\) with \(k\) 1's. This is also the number of bit string of length \(n\) with \(k\) 0's (just replace each 1 with a 0 and each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length \(n\) has \(k\) 0's, it must have \(n-k\) 1's. And there are exactly \({n\choose n-k}\) strings of length \(n\) with \(n-k\) 1's.
