<div class="para">We cannot do the reverse of this though. If there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> for which every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> satisfies <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\text{,}\)</span> then certainly for every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> which satisfies <span class="process-math">\(P(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> The first is saying we can find one <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that works for every <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> The second allows different <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>'s to work for different <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>'s, but there is nothing preventing us from using the same <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> that work for every <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> In other words, while we don't have logical equivalence between the two statements, we do have a valid deduction rule:</div>
