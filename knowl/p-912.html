<div class="para">This is just the truth table for <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{,}\)</span> but what matters here is that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> Which <em class="emphasis">rows</em> of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has <span class="process-math">\(P
\imp Q\)</span> true as well. And lo-and-behold, in this one case, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is also true. So if <span class="process-math">\(P\imp
Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> are both true, we see that <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> must be true as well.</div>
