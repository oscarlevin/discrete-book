<div class="para"> We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers <span class="process-math">\((0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots)\text{,}\)</span> when we start with <span class="process-math">\(n=0\text{,}\)</span> and the powers of 2: <span class="process-math">\((1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span> Note that if subtract 1 from each term, we get the sequence <span class="process-math">\((T_n)\text{.}\)</span> So we have <span class="process-math">\(b_n = T_n + 1\text{.}\)</span> Therefore a closed formula is <span class="process-math">\(b_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\text{.}\)</span> A quick check of the first few <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> confirms we have it right.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((3, 5, 9, 17, 33, \ldots )\text{.}\)</span> Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is <span class="process-math">\(c_n = a_n+1 = 2^n + 1\text{.}\)</span> If we try this though, we get <span class="process-math">\(c_0 = 2^0 + 1 = 2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c_1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3\text{.}\)</span> We are off because the indices are shifted. What we really want is <span class="process-math">\(c_n = a_{n+1}+1\)</span> giving <span class="process-math">\(c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">(<span class="process-math">\(0, 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, 42,\ldots \)</span>). Notice that all these terms are even. What happens if we factor out a 2? We get <span class="process-math">\((T_n)\text{!}\)</span> More precisely, we find that <span class="process-math">\(d_n/2 = T_n\text{,}\)</span> so this sequence has closed formula <span class="process-math">\(d_n = n(n+1)\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span> These are all triangular numbers. However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term. So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <span class="process-math">\(T_n\text{,}\)</span> we would be set. Therefore the closed formula is <span class="process-math">\(e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(n+3\)</span> came from <span class="process-math">\((n+2)+1\)</span>). Thinking about sequences as functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: <span class="process-math">\(e_n = T_{n+2}\)</span> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, \ldots )\text{.}\)</span> Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2. You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term (the powers of 2 are <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> twice the previous term). Closed formula: <span class="process-math">\(f_n = 2^{n} - 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots )\text{.}\)</span> These numbers are also doubling each time, but are also all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, …. Aha. We get the closed formula <span class="process-math">\(g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((6, 10, 18, 34, 66, \ldots )\text{.}\)</span> To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back to <span class="process-math">\(2^n\text{.}\)</span> Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get <span class="process-math">\(h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2\)</span> (the <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span> is because the first term is 2 more than <span class="process-math">\(2^2\text{,}\)</span> not <span class="process-math">\(2^0\)</span>). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, … we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula <span class="process-math">\(c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1\text{.}\)</span> Our sequence here would be twice this, so <span class="process-math">\(h_n = 2(2^n + 1)\text{,}\)</span> which is the same as we got before.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\((15, 33, 57, 87, 123, \ldots)\text{.}\)</span> Try dividing each term by 3. That gives the sequence <span class="process-math">\(5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots\text{.}\)</span> Now add 1 to each term: <span class="process-math">\(6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\((d_n)\)</span> in this example, except starting with 6 instead of 0. So let's start with the formula <span class="process-math">\(d_n= n(n+1)\text{.}\)</span> To start with the 6, we shift: <span class="process-math">\((n+2)(n+3)\text{.}\)</span> But this is one too many, so subtract 1: <span class="process-math">\((n+2)(n+3) - 1\text{.}\)</span> That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3. So we want <span class="process-math">\(j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)\text{.}\)</span>
