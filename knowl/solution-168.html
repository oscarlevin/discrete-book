<div class="para">By now it should be no surprise that there are <span class="process-math">\(8^5\)</span> words, and <span class="process-math">\(P(8,5)\)</span> words without repeated letters. The new piece here is that we are actually counting functions. For the first problem, we are counting all functions from <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\ldots, 5\}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,\ldots, h\}\text{.}\)</span> The numbers in the domain represent the <em class="emphasis">position</em> of the letter in the word, the codomain represents the letter that could be assigned to that position. If we ask for no repeated letters, we are asking for injective functions.</div> <div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are <em class="emphasis">any</em> sets with <span class="process-math">\(|A| = 5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|B| = 8\text{,}\)</span> then the number of functions <span class="process-math">\(f: A \to B\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(8^5\)</span> and the number of injections is <span class="process-math">\(P(8,5)\text{.}\)</span> So if you can represent your counting problem as a function counting problem, most of the work is done.</div>
