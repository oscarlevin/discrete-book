We don't know what <span class="process-math">\(f(5)\)</span> is though. Well, we know that <span class="process-math">\(f(5) = f(4) + 9\text{.}\)</span> So we need to compute <span class="process-math">\(f(4)\text{,}\)</span> which will require knowing <span class="process-math">\(f(3)\text{,}\)</span> which will require <span class="process-math">\(f(2)\text{,}\)</span>… will it ever end?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Yes! In fact, this process will always end because we have <span class="process-math">\(\N\)</span> as our domain, so there is a least element. And we gave the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(0)\)</span> explicitly, so we are good. In fact, we might decide to work up to <span class="process-math">\(f(6)\)</span> instead of working down from <span class="process-math">\(f(6)\text{:}\)</span>
