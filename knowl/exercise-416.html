<div class="para">We say that a set of vertices <span class="process-math">\(A \subseteq V\)</span> is a <dfn class="terminology">vertex cover</dfn> if every edge of the graph is incident to a vertex in the cover (so a vertex cover covers the <em class="emphasis">edges</em>). Since <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> itself is a vertex cover, every graph has a vertex cover. The interesting question is about finding a <dfn class="terminology">minimal</dfn> vertex cover, one that uses the fewest possible number of vertices.</div>
