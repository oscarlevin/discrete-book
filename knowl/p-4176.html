<div class="para">In each of the examples above, we found the difference between consecutive terms which gave us a sequence of differences for which we knew a generating function. We can generalize this to more complicated relationships between terms of the sequence. For example, if we know that the sequence satisfies the recurrence relation <span class="process-math">\(a_n = 3a_{n-1} - 2a_{n-2}\text{?}\)</span> In other words, if we take a term of the sequence and subtract 3 times the previous term and then add 2 times the term before that, we get 0 (since <span class="process-math">\(a_n - 3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2} = 0\)</span>). That will hold for all but the first two terms of the sequence. So after the first two terms, the sequence of results of these calculations would be a sequence of 0's, for which we definitely know a generating function.</div>
