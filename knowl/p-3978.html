<div class="para">Some context might make this easier to understand. Think of the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as representing students in a class, and the vertices in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> as representing presentation topics. We put an edge from a vertex <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> to a vertex <span class="process-math">\(b \in B\)</span> if student <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> would like to present on topic <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Of course, some students would want to present on more than one topic, so their vertex would have degree greater than 1. As the teacher, you want to assign each student their own unique topic. Thus you want to find a matching of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{:}\)</span> you pick some subset of the edges so that each student gets matched up with exactly one topic, and no topic gets matched to two students.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-24-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a>
