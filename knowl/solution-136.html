<div class="para">There are <span class="process-math">\({13 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids (using 10 stars and 3 bars). We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3 or more cookies. How many outcomes are there like that? We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him 3 cookies before we start. Doing so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions. In that case, we have 7 stars (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 bars (one less than the number of kids) so we can distribute the cookies in <span class="process-math">\({10 \choose 3}\)</span> ways. Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to give too many cookies, so it would appear that there are <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid. But in fact, we have over counted.</div> <div class="para">We must get rid of the outcomes in which two kids have too many cookies. There are <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 2}\)</span> ways to select 2 kids to give extra cookies. It takes 6 cookies to do this, leaving only 4 cookies. So we have 4 stars and still 3 bars. The remaining 4 cookies can thus be distributed in <span class="process-math">\({7 \choose 3}\)</span> ways (for each of the <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 2}\)</span> choices of which 2 kids to over-feed).</div> <div class="para">But now we have removed too much. We must add back in all the ways to give too many cookies to three kids. This uses 9 cookies, leaving only 1 to distribute to the 4 kids using stars and bars, which can be done in <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 3}\)</span> ways. We must consider this outcome for every possible choice of which three kids we over-feed, and there are <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 3}\)</span> ways of selecting that set of 3 kids.</div> <div class="para">Next we would subtract all the ways to give four kids too many cookies, but in this case, that number is 0.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">All together we get that the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids without giving any kid more than 2 cookies is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{13 \choose 3} - \left[{4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3} - {4 \choose 2}{7 \choose 3} + {4\choose 3}{4\choose 3}\right]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
286 - [480 - 210 + 16] = 0\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This makes sense: there is NO way to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids and make sure that nobody gets more than 2. It is slightly surprising that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{13 \choose 3} = \left[{4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3} - {4 \choose 2}{7 \choose 3} + {4\choose 3}{4\choose 3}\right]\text{,}
