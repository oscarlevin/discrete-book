<li><div class="para">This is the set <span class="process-math">\(\{2, 3, 4 \ldots \}\)</span> since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least 2 more than 1. Since <span class="process-math">\(2^2 - 2 = 2\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(1^2 - 2 = -1\)</span> we see that the first such natural number is 2.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">We get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - 3\)</span> is a natural number is 2.</div>
<div class="para">Note that if we didn’t specify <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 0\)</span> by saying that <span class="process-math">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span> then any integer less than <span class="process-math">\(-2\)</span> would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">This is the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\)</span> namely the set of numbers that are the <em class="emphasis">result</em> of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number.  (<span class="process-math">\(0^2 + 1 = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(1^2 + 1 = 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(2^2 + 1 = 5\)</span> and so on.)  Thus the least element of the set is 1.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1.  That is, <span class="process-math">\(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\)</span> the same set as the previous part.  So again, the least element is 1.</div></li>
