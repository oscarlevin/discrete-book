<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">There are <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions all together, two choices for where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain. Now of these, the functions which are <em class="emphasis">not</em> surjective must exclude one or more elements of the codomain from the range. So first, consider functions for which <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is not in the range. This can only happen one way: everything gets sent to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Alternatively, we could exclude <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> from the range. Then everything gets sent to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> so there is only one function like this. These are the only ways in which a function could not be surjective (no function excludes both <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> from the range) so there are exactly <span class="process-math">\(2^5 - 2\)</span> surjective functions.</div></div></body>
