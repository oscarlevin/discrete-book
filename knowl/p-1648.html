<div class="para">First, a simpler question: How many subsets of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are there total? In other words, what is <span class="process-math">\(|\pow(A)|\)</span> (the cardinality of the power set of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span>)? Think about how we would build a subset. We need to decide, for each of the elements of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> whether or not to include the element in our subset. So we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 1. And for each choice we make, we need to decide “yes” or “no” for the element 2. And so on. For each of the 5 elements, we have 2 choices. Therefore the number of subsets is simply <span class="process-math">\(2\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdot 2\cdot 2 = 2^5\)</span> (by the multiplicative principle).</div>
