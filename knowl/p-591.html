<div class="para">Suppose I made that statement to Bob. In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar? What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final, and he did pass the class? Then I have not lied; my statement is true. However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class, then I lied, making the statement false. The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final? Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't. Did I lie in either case? I think not. In these last two cases, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> was false, and the statement <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> was true. In the first case, <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> was true, and so was <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(P \imp Q\)</span> is true when either <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is false or <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true.</div>
