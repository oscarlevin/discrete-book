<li><div class="para">If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it, we will get a number of beans ending in a 0 (since <span class="process-math">\(5\cdot 2 = 10\)</span> ). Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5. Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">If you don't <em class="emphasis">start</em> with a number of beans ending in a 5 (on day 1), the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful. For example, if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a) again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4</div>
<div class="para">The proof by induction would say that on <em class="emphasis">every</em> day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
