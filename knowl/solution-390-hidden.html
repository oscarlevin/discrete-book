<div class="para">We want to classify numbers by what their remainder would be when divided by <span class="process-math">\(5\text{.}\)</span> From the division algorithm, we know there will be exactly 5 remainder classes, because there are only 5 choices for what <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> could be (<span class="process-math">\(0 \le r \lt 5\)</span>).</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">First consider <span class="process-math">\(r = 0\text{.}\)</span> Here we are looking for all the numbers divisible by <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(a = 5q+0\text{.}\)</span> In other words, the multiples of 5. We get the infinite set</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\{\ldots, -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, \ldots\}\text{.}

</div> <div class="para">Notice we also include negative integers.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Next consider <span class="process-math">\(r = 1\text{.}\)</span> Which integers, when divided by 5, have remainder 1? Well, certainly 1, does, as does 6, and 11. Negatives? Here we must be careful: <span class="process-math">\(-6\)</span> does NOT have remainder 1. We can write <span class="process-math">\(-6 = -2\cdot 5 + 4\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-6 = -1 \cdot 5 - 1\text{,}\)</span> but only one of these is a “correct” instance of the division algorithm: <span class="process-math">\(r = 4\)</span> since we need <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> to be non-negative. So in fact, to get <span class="process-math">\(r = 1\text{,}\)</span> we would have <span class="process-math">\(-4\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-9\text{,}\)</span> etc. Thus we get the remainder class</div>
