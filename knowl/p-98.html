<div class="para">Our list of structures could go on and on, but we will stop here.  We will not spend much time at all looking at <dfn class="terminology">multisets</dfn>, which are just like sets except can have repeated elements.  Since this is not a geometry class, we will not consider <dfn class="terminology">finite geometries</dfn>, or <dfn class="terminology">designs</dfn> (which are somewhere between graphs and geometries).  Discrete structures are useful in computer science, but we will stop short of studying <dfn class="terminology">linked lists</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">rooted trees</dfn>. Although abstract algebra is a fascinating subject, we will not get to <dfn class="terminology">groups</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">rings</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">metroids</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">POSets</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">Boolean algebras</dfn> or ... These are examples of sets on which we define additional operations and study the algebraic structure of how the sets and operations interact.</div>
