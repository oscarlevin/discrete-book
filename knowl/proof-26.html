<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement “it is possible to make exactly <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps.” We will show <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 28\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">First, we show that <span class="process-math">\(P(28)\)</span> is true: <span class="process-math">\(28 = 4 \cdot 5+ 1\cdot 8\text{,}\)</span> so we can make <span class="process-math">\(28\)</span> cents using four 5-cent stamps and one 8-cent stamp.</div> <div class="para">Now suppose <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true for some arbitrary <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{.}\)</span> Then it is possible to make <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using 5-cent and 8-cent stamps. Note that since <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 28\text{,}\)</span> it cannot be that we use fewer than three 5-cent stamps <em class="emphasis">and</em> fewer than three 8-cent stamps: using two of each would give only 26 cents. Now if we have made <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using at least three 5-cent stamps, replace three 5-cent stamps by two 8-cent stamps. This replaces 15 cents of postage with 16 cents, moving from a total of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents to <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> cents. Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. On the other hand, if we have made <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> cents using at least three 8-cent stamps, then we can replace three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps, moving from 24 cents to 25 cents, giving a total of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> cents of postage. So in this case as well <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true.</div> <div class="para">Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 28\text{.}\)</span>
