<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like"><div class="para">This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters, only now we have more choices for each letter. For the first letter, there are 6 choices. For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second letter. Then there are 4 choices for the third letter, and 3 choices for the last letter. The total number of words is <span class="process-math">\(6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360\text{.}\)</span> This is not <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> because we never multiplied by 2 and 1. We could start with <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write <span class="process-math">\(\frac{6!}{2!}\text{.}\)</span>
