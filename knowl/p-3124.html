<div class="para">Still you might start to believe that you can prove anything with induction. Consider this incorrect “proof” that every Canadian  has the same eye color: Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement that any <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> Canadians have the same eye color. <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is true, since everyone has the same eye color as themselves. Now assume <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That is, assume that in any group of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> Canadians, everyone has the same eye color. Now consider an arbitrary group of <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> Canadians. The first <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must all have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. Also, the last <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of these must have the same eye color, since <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. So in fact, everyone the group must have the same eye color. Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true. So by the principle of mathematical induction, <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
