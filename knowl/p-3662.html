<div class="para">Now for the inductive case, fix <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 1\)</span> and assume that all trees with <span class="process-math">\(v=k\)</span> vertices have exactly <span class="process-math">\(e=k-1\)</span> edges.  Now consider an arbitrary tree <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(v = k+1\)</span> vertices.  By <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/prop-leaves-in-trees.html" title="Proposition 4.2.3">Proposition 4.2.3</a>, <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> has a vertex <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> of degree one.  Let <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> be the tree resulting from removing <span class="process-math">\(v_0\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> (together with its incident edge).  Since we removed a leaf, <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> is still a tree (the unique paths between pairs of vertices in <span class="process-math">\(T'\)</span> are the same as the unique paths between them in <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span>).</div>
