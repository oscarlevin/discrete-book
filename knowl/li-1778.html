<p>If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately, we get a total of 64. This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces. Could they all belong to 4 faces? That would mean there were <span class="process-math">\(64/4 = 16\)</span> vertices, but we know from Euler's formula that there must be 18 vertices. We can write <span class="process-math">\(64 = 3x + 4y\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (as integers). We get that there must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note the number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph theoretic terms.)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_gt-conc.html#OBv" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
