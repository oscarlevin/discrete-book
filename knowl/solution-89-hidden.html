<li><div class="para">For any number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if it is the case that adding any number to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gives that number back, then multiplying any number by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> will give 0. This is true (of the integers or the reals). The “if” part only holds if <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> and in that case, anything times <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> will be 0.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The converse in words is this: for any number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if everything times <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is zero, then everything added to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gives itself. Or in symbols: <span class="process-math">\(\forall x (\forall z (x \cdot z = 0) \imp \forall y (x + y = y))\text{.}\)</span> The converse is true: the only number which when multiplied by any other number gives 0 is <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span> And if <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(x + y = y\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The contrapositive in words is: for any number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> if there is some number which when multiplied by <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> does not give zero, then there is some number which when added to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> does not give that number. In symbols: <span class="process-math">\(\forall x (\exists z (x\cdot z \ne 0) \imp \exists y (x + y \ne y))\text{.}\)</span> We know the contrapositive must be true because the original implication is true.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The negation: there is a number <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> such that any number added to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gives the number back again, but there is a number you can multiply <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by and not get 0. In symbols: <span class="process-math">\(\exists x (\forall y (x + y = y) \wedge \exists z (x \cdot z \ne 0))\text{.}\)</span> Of course since the original implication is true, the negation is false.</div></li>
