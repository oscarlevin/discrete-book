<div class="para">Let's think a bit about how we could find the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> for some specific <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> (the “value” will be either <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span>). How did we find the value of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term of a sequence of numbers? How did we find <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{?}\)</span> There were two ways we could do this: either there was a closed formula for <span class="process-math">\(a_n\text{,}\)</span> so we could plug in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> into the formula and get our output value, or we had a recursive definition for the sequence, so we could use the previous terms of the sequence to compute the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term. When dealing with sequences of statements, we could use either of these techniques as well. Maybe there is a way to use <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> itself to determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That would be something like a closed formula. Or instead we could use the previous terms in the sequence (of statements) to determine whether we can make <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cents of postage. That is, if we know the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n-1)\text{,}\)</span> can we get from that to the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\text{?}\)</span> That would be something like a recursive definition for the sequence. Remember, finding recursive definitions for sequences was often easier than finding closed formulas. The same is true here.</div>
