<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> be an element of the codomain <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{.}\)</span> We will show there is an element <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> of the domain (<span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span>) such that <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = y\text{.}\)</span> There are two cases: First, if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is even, then let <span class="process-math">\(n = y+3\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is even, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is odd, so <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y\)</span> as desired. Second, if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is odd, then let <span class="process-math">\(n = y-1\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is odd, <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even, so <span class="process-math">\(f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y\)</span> as needed. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is surjective.</div></article>
