<div class="para">First, let's think inductively about this equation. In fact, we know this is true for other reasons (reverse and add comes to mind). But why might induction be applicable? The left-hand side adds up the numbers from 1 to <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If we know how to do that, adding just one more term (<span class="process-math">\(n+1\)</span>) would not be that hard. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(n = 100\text{,}\)</span> suppose we know that the sum of the first 100 numbers is <span class="process-math">\(5050\)</span> (so <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 = 5050\text{,}\)</span> which is true). Now to find the sum of the first 101 numbers, it makes more sense to just add 101 to 5050, instead of computing the entire sum again. We would have <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 100 + 101 = 5050 + 101 = 5151\text{.}\)</span> In fact, it would always be easy to add just one more term. This is why we should use induction.</div> <div class="para">Now the formal proof:</div> <article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> be the statement <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Base case: <span class="process-math">\(P(1)\)</span> is the statement <span class="process-math">\(1 = \frac{1(1+1)}{2}\)</span> which is clearly true.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Inductive case: Let <span class="process-math">\(k \ge 1\)</span> be a natural number. Assume (for induction) that <span class="process-math">\(P(k)\)</span> is true. That means <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> We will prove that <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true as well. That is, we must prove that <span class="process-math">\(1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}\text{.}\)</span> To prove this equation, start by adding <span class="process-math">\(k+1\)</span> to both sides of the inductive hypothesis:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + k + (k+1) = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now, simplifying the right side we get:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{k(k+1)}{2} + k+1 \amp = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + \frac{2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{k(k+1) + 2(k+1)}{2}\\
\amp = \frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para">Thus <span class="process-math">\(P(k+1)\)</span> is true, so by the principle of mathematical induction <span class="process-math">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all natural numbers <span class="process-math">\(n \ge 1\text{.}\)</span>
