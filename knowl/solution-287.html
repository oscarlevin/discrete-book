<div class="para">Even before we know what the divides symbol means, we can set up a direct proof for this statement. It will go something like this: Let <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> be arbitrary integers. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(a|b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b|c\text{.}\)</span> Dot dot dot. Therefore <span class="process-math">\(a|c\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">How do we connect the dots? We say what our hypothesis (<span class="process-math">\(a|b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b|c\)</span>) really means and why this gives us what the conclusion (<span class="process-math">\(a|c\)</span>) really means. Another way to say that <span class="process-math">\(a|b\)</span> is to say that <span class="process-math">\(b = ka\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> (that is, that <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>). What are we going for? That <span class="process-math">\(c = la\text{,}\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> (because we want <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to be a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>). Here is the complete proof.</div> <article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> be integers. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(a|b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b|c\text{.}\)</span> In other words, <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> So there are integers <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(j\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(b = ka\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c = jb\text{.}\)</span> Combining these (through substitution) we get that <span class="process-math">\(c = jka\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(jk\)</span> is an integer, so this says that <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Therefore <span class="process-math">\(a|c\text{.}\)</span>
