<div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">You must simply choose 6 friends from a group of 14. This can be done in <span class="process-math">\({14 \choose 6}\)</span> ways. We can find this number either by using Pascal's triangle or the closed formula: <span class="process-math">\(\frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!} = 3003\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li>
<div class="para">Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14. So the answer is <span class="process-math">\(P(14, 6)\text{,}\)</span> which can be calculated as <span class="process-math">\(\frac{14!}{8!} = 2162160\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions: how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).</div>
</li>
</ol></div> <div class="para">How are these numbers related? Notice that <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> is <em class="emphasis">much</em> larger than <span class="process-math">\({14 \choose 6}\text{.}\)</span> This makes sense. <span class="process-math">\({14 \choose 6}\)</span> picks 6 friends, but <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them. In fact, we can say exactly how much larger <span class="process-math">\(P(14,6)\)</span> is. In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends. For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways. But for the second counting problem, each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> ways. So now we have <span class="process-math">\(3003\cdot 6!\)</span> choices and that is exactly <span class="process-math">\(2162160\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Alternatively, look at the first problem another way. We want to select 6 out of 14 friends, but we do not care about the order they are selected in. To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">This is a reasonable guess, since we have 14 choices for the first guest, then 13 for the second, and so on. But the guess is wrong (in fact, that product is exactly <span class="process-math">\(2162160 = P(14,6)\)</span>). It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests. To correct for this, we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests (so that all of these would count as just one outcome). There are precisely <span class="process-math">\(6!\)</span> ways to arrange 6 guests, so the correct answer to the first question is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Note that another way to write this is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which is what we had originally.</div>
