<div class="para">Designate any vertex as the root.  Put this vertex in set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>  Now put all of the children of the root in set <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>  None of these children are adjacent (they are siblings), so we are good so far.  Now put into <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> every child of every vertex in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> (i.e., every grandchild of the root).  Keep going until all vertices have been assigned one of the sets, alternating between <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> every “generation.”  That is, a vertex is in set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> if and only if it is the child of a vertex in set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span>
