<div class="para">You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences. After all, it is harder to find <span class="process-math">\(a_n\)</span> with a recursive definition than with a closed formula. This is true, but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition. So to find a useful closed formula, we might first find the recursive definition, then use that to find the closed formula.</div>
