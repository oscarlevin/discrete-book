<div class="para">For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a graph. You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the polyhedron and then taking its planar dual: put a vertex in the center of each face (including the outside) and connect two vertices if their faces share an edge.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel, it's chromatic number is at least 4. Alternatively, suppose you could color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored the same. Take any face and color it blue. The 5 pentagons bordering this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue. Color the first one red. Its two neighbors (adjacent to the blue pentagon) get colored green. The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green, but also cannot both be red since they are adjacent to each other. Thus a 4th color is needed.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph. Thus by the 4-color theorem, it can be colored using only 4 colors without two adjacent vertices (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron) being colored identically.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The cube can be properly 3-colored. Color the “top” and “bottom” red, the “front” and “back” blue, and the “left” and “right” green.</div></li>
