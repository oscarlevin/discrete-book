<div class="para">In this example, since the modulus is small, we could simply try every possible value for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> There are really only 5 to consider, since any integer that satisfied the congruence could be replaced with any other integer it was congruent to modulo 5. Here, when <span class="process-math">\(x = 4\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\(3x + 2 = 14\)</span> which is indeed congruent to 4 modulo 5. This means that <span class="process-math">\(x = 9\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 14\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 19\)</span> and so on will each also be a solution because as we saw above, replacing any number in a congruence with a congruent number does not change the truth of the congruence.</div>
