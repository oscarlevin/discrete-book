<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<div class="para">Why is this true? <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> things from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things to exclude from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. Clearly this is <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things, then you are including the other <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.</div> <div class="para">Let's try the pizza counting example like we did above. How many ways are there to pick <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings from a list of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices? On the one hand, the answer is simply <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> Alternatively, you could make a list of all the toppings you don't want. To end up with a pizza containing exactly <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings, you need to pick <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> toppings to not put on the pizza. You have <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> choices for the toppings you don't want. Both of these ways give you a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings, in fact all the ways to get a pizza with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings. Thus these two answers must be the same: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k} = {n \choose n-k}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">You can also prove (explain) this identity using bit strings, subsets, or lattice paths. The bit string argument is nice: <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> counts the number of bit strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1's. This is also the number of bit string of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 0's (just replace each 1 with a 0 and each 0 with a 1). But if a string of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 0's, it must have <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> 1's. And there are exactly <span class="process-math">\({n\choose n-k}\)</span> strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> 1's.</div>
