<div class="para">Suppose, contrary to stipulation, that each of the pigeon holes contain at most one pigeon. Then at most, there will be <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> pigeons. But we assumed that there are more than <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> pigeons, so this is impossible. Thus there must be a pigeonhole with more than one pigeon.</div></article> <div class="para">While we phrased this proof as a proof by contradiction, we could have also used a proof by contrapositive since our contradiction was simply the negation of the hypothesis. Sometimes this will happen, in which case you can use either style of proof. There are examples however where the contradiction occurs “far away” from the original statement.</div>
