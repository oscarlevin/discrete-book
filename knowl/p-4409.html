<p>Suppose <span class="process-math">\(ad \equiv bd \pmod n\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we have <span class="process-math">\(ad = bd + kn\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> Of course <span class="process-math">\(ad\)</span> is divisible by <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> as is <span class="process-math">\(bd\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(kn\)</span> must also be divisible by <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> Now if <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> have no common factors (other than 1), then we must have <span class="process-math">\(d \mid k\text{.}\)</span> But in general, if we try to divide <span class="process-math">\(kn\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(d\text{,}\)</span> we don't know that we will get an integer multiple of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Some of the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> might get divided as well. To be safe, let's divide as much of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as we can. Take the largest factor of both <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> and cancel that out from <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> The rest of the factors of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> will come from <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> no problem.</p>
