<div class="para">So far we have seen methods for finding the closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Since we know how to compute the sum of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms of arithmetic and geometric sequences, we can compute the closed formulas for sequences which have an arithmetic (or geometric) sequence of differences between terms. But what if we consider a sequence which is the sum of the first <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> terms of a sequence which is itself the sum of an arithmetic sequence?</div>
