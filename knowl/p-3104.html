<div class="para">Again, start by understanding the dynamics of the problem. What does increasing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? Let's try with a few examples. If <span class="process-math">\(n = 1\text{,}\)</span> then yes, <span class="process-math">\(6^1 - 1 = 5\)</span> is a multiple of 5. What does incrementing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to 2 look like? We get <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1 = 35\text{,}\)</span> which again is a multiple of 5. Next, <span class="process-math">\(n = 3\text{:}\)</span> but instead of just finding <span class="process-math">\(6^3 - 1\text{,}\)</span> what did the increase in <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> do? We will still subtract 1, but now we are multiplying by another 6 first. Viewed another way, we are multiplying a number which is one more than a multiple of 5 by 6 (because <span class="process-math">\(6^2 - 1\)</span> is a multiple of 5, so <span class="process-math">\(6^2\)</span> is one more than a multiple of 5). What do numbers which are one more than a multiple of 5 look like? They must have last digit 1 or 6. What happens when you multiply such a number by 6? Depends on the number, but in any case, the last digit of the new number must be a 6. And then if you subtract 1, you get last digit 5, so a multiple of 5.</div>
