<div class="para">Again start with the total number of functions: <span class="process-math">\(3^5\)</span> (as each of the five elements of the domain can go to any of three elements of the codomain). Now we count the functions which are <em class="emphasis">not</em> surjective.</div> <div class="para">Start by excluding <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range. Then we have two choices (<span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>) for where to send each of the five elements of the domain. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions which exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range. Similarly, there are <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions which exclude <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and another <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> which exclude <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Now have we counted all functions which are not surjective? Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times. For example, the function which sends everything to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> was one of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions we counted when we excluded <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range, and also one of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions we counted when we excluded <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> from the range. We must subtract out all the functions which specifically exclude two elements from the range. There is 1 function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> (everything goes to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>), one function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and one function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We are using PIE: to count the functions which are not surjective, we added up the functions which exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> separately, then subtracted the functions which exclude pairs of elements. We would then add back in the functions which exclude groups of three elements, except that there are no such functions. We find that the number of functions which are <em class="emphasis">not</em> surjective is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
2^5 + 2^5 + 2^5 - 1 - 1 - 1 + 0\text{.}

<div class="para">Perhaps a more descriptive way to write this is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
{3 \choose 1}2^5 - {3 \choose 2}1^5 + {3 \choose 3}0^5\text{.}

<div class="para">since each of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span>'s was the result of choosing 1 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude from the range, each of the three <span class="process-math">\(1^5\)</span>'s was the result of choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude. Writing <span class="process-math">\(1^5\)</span> instead of 1 makes sense too: we have 1 choice of where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.</div>

<div class="para">Now we can finally count the number of surjective functions:</div>
