<div class="para">Start by excluding <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range. Then we have two choices (<span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>) for where to send each of the five elements of the domain. Thus there are <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions which exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range. Similarly, there are <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions which exclude <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and another <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> which exclude <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> Now have we counted all functions which are not surjective? Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times. For example, the function which sends everything to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> was one of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions we counted when we excluded <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> from the range, and also one of the <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions we counted when we excluded <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> from the range. We must subtract out all the functions which specifically exclude two elements from the range. There is 1 function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> (everything goes to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span>), one function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> and one function when we exclude <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
