<div class="para">To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the right-hand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right-hand side: <span class="process-math">\({n+2 \choose 3}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span> things. Let's name those things <span class="process-math">\(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n+2\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these subsets. Here's the proof.</div> <article class="proof"><h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Proof<span class="period">.</span></span></h5>
<div class="para">Consider the question “How many 3-element subsets are there of the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,3,\ldots,
n+2\}\text{?}\)</span>” We answer this in two ways:</div> <div class="para">Answer 1: We must select 3 elements from the collection of <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span> elements. This can be done in <span class="process-math">\({n+2 \choose 3}\)</span> ways.</div> <div class="para">Answer 2: Break this problem up into cases by what the middle number in the subset is. Say each subset is <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> written in increasing order. We count the number of subsets for each distinct value of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> The smallest possible value of <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> and the largest is <span class="process-math">\(n+1\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(b = 2\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(1 \cdot n\)</span> subsets: 1 choice for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices (3 through <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span>) for <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(b = 3\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(2 \cdot (n-1)\)</span> subsets: 2 choices for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices for <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">When <span class="process-math">\(b = 4\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(3 \cdot (n-2)\)</span> subsets: 3 choices for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n-2\)</span> choices for <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">And so on. When <span class="process-math">\(b = n+1\text{,}\)</span> there are <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and only 1 choice for <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(n \cdot 1\)</span> subsets.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Therefore the total number of subsets is</div>

\begin{equation*}
1 n + 2 (n-1) + 3 (n-2) + \cdots + (n-1)2 + n 1\text{.}

<div class="para">Since Answer 1 and Answer 2 are answers to the same question, they must be equal. Therefore</div>
