<div class="para">The easiest way to see this is to consider bit strings. <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> is the number of bit strings of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1's. Of all of these strings, some start with a 1 and the rest start with a 0. First consider all the bit strings which start with a 1. After the 1, there must be <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> more bits (to get the total length up to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>) and exactly <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> of them must be 1's (as we already have one, and we need <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> total). How many strings are there like that? There are exactly <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> such bit strings, so of all the length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> bit strings containing <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1's, <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> of them start with a 1. Similarly, there are <span class="process-math">\({n-1\choose k}\)</span> which start with a 0 (we still need <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> bits and now <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> of them must be 1's). Since there are <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k}\)</span> bit strings containing <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> bits with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1's, that is the number of length <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> bit strings with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> 1's which start with a 0. Therefore <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Another way: consider the question, how many ways can you select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> pizza toppings from a menu containing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices? One way to do this is just <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> Another way to answer the same question is to first decide whether or not you want anchovies. If you do want anchovies, you still need to pick <span class="process-math">\(k-1\)</span> toppings, now from just <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices. That can be done in <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}\)</span> ways. If you do not want anchovies, then you still need to select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> toppings from <span class="process-math">\(n-1\)</span> choices (the anchovies are out). You can do that in <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k}\)</span> ways. Since the choices with anchovies are disjoint from the choices without anchovies, the total choices are <span class="process-math">\({n-1 \choose k-1}+{n-1 \choose k}\text{.}\)</span> But wait. We answered the same question in two different ways, so the two answers must be the same. Thus <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k} = {n-1\choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}\text{.}\)</span>
