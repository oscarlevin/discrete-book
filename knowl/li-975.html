<div class="para">The number of surjective functions is:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
5^5 - \left[{5 \choose 1}4^5 - {5 \choose 2}3^5 + {5 \choose 3}2^5 - {5 \choose 4}1^5\right]\text{.}

<div class="para">We took the total number of functions <span class="process-math">\(5^5\)</span> and subtracted all that were not surjective. There were <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 1}\)</span> ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range, and for each there were <span class="process-math">\(4^5\)</span> functions. But this double counts, so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range: there are <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 2}\)</span> choices for the two elements to exclude, and for each pair, <span class="process-math">\(3^5\)</span> functions. This takes out too many functions, so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range: <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 3}\)</span> choices for which three to exclude, and then <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions for each choice of elements. Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 4}\)</span> choices of 4 elements.</div>

<div class="para">If you happen to calculate this number precisely, you will get 120 surjections. That happens to also be the value of <span class="process-math">\(5!\text{.}\)</span> This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function <span class="process-math">\(f:X \to Y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(\card{X} = \card{Y}\)</span> finite must necessarily be a bijection. The number of bijections is always <span class="process-math">\(\card{X}!\)</span> in this case. What we have here is a <em class="emphasis">combinatorial proof</em> of the following identity:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
n^n - \left[{n\choose 1}(n-1)^n - {n \choose 2}(n-2)^n + \cdots + {n \choose n-1}1^n \right] = n!\text{.}
