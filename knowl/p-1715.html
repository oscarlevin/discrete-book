<div class="para">We took the total number of functions <span class="process-math">\(5^5\)</span> and subtracted all that were not surjective. There were <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 1}\)</span> ways to select a single element from the codomain to exclude from the range, and for each there were <span class="process-math">\(4^5\)</span> functions. But this double counts, so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range: there are <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 2}\)</span> choices for the two elements to exclude, and for each pair, <span class="process-math">\(3^5\)</span> functions. This takes out too many functions, so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range: <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 3}\)</span> choices for which three to exclude, and then <span class="process-math">\(2^5\)</span> functions for each choice of elements. Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the <span class="process-math">\({5 \choose 4}\)</span> choices of 4 elements.</div>
