<div class="para">There are <span class="process-math">\({13 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids (using 10 stars and 3 bars). We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3 or more cookies. How many outcomes are there like that? We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him 3 cookies before we start. Doing so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions. In that case, we have 7 stars (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 bars (one less than the number of kids) so we can distribute the cookies in <span class="process-math">\({10 \choose 3}\)</span> ways. Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to give too many cookies, so it would appear that there are <span class="process-math">\({4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3}\)</span> ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid. But in fact, we have over counted.</div>
