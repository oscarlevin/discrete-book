<div class="para">Suppose I told you that <span class="process-math">\(P(43)\)</span> was true (it is). Can you determine from this fact the value of <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> (whether it true or false)? Yes you can. Even if we don't know how exactly we made 43 cents out of the 5-cent and 8-cent stamps, we do know that there was some way to do it. What if that way used at least three 5-cent stamps (making 15 cents)? We could replace those three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps (making 16 cents). The total postage has gone up by 1, so we have a way to make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is true. Of course, we assumed that we had at least three 5-cent stamps. What if we didn't? Then we must have at least three 8-cent stamps (making 24 cents). If we replace those three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps (making 25 cents) then again we have bumped up our total by 1 cent so we can make 44 cents, so <span class="process-math">\(P(44)\)</span> is true.</div>
