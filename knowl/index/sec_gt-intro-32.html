<div class="para"> Back to some basic graph theory definitions. Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once, and no vertex is connected to itself. Graphs like these are sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">simple</dfn>, although we will just call them <em class="emphasis">graphs</em>. This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices. Remember that it doesn’t make sense to say a set contains an element more than once. So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once. Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices, we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.</div>
