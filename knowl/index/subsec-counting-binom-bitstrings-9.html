<div class="para">It is not surprising then that the same relationship between Pascal’s triangle and lattice paths holds for bit strings.  Look at the 10 strings above.  The first row contains all the bit strings of <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> that end in a 0.  Before that ending 0, we have a string in <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_3\text{,}\)</span> since it must have length 4 and weight 3 (the ending 0 adds one to the length, but adds zero to the weight).  The second row contains all the bit strings of <span class="process-math">\(\B^5_3\)</span> that end in a 1.  Before that ending 1, we have a string in <span class="process-math">\(\B^4_2\text{,}\)</span> since it must have length 4 and weight 2 (the ending 1 adds one to the length, but adds one to the weight).  So the number of 5-bit strings of weight 3 is the sum of the number of 4-bit strings of weight 3 and the number of 4-bit strings of weight 2.  In symbols:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
|\B^5_3| = |\B^4_3| + |\B^4_2|\text{.}
\end{equation*}
