<div class="para">First, how many two letter words start with A? We just need to select the second letter, which can be accomplished in 26 ways. So there are 26 words starting with A. There are also 26 words that start with B. To select a word which starts with either A or B, we can pick the word from the first 26 or the second 26, for a total of 52 words.</div> <div class="para">We have two sets of outcomes: the words starting with A and the words starting with B. We create a new set of outcomes by combining the sets to get the set of words that start with either A or B, and by the sum principle, this new set contains 52 outcomes.</div>
