<div class="para">The statement about monopoly is an example of a <dfn class="terminology">tautology</dfn>,  a statement which is true on the basis of its logical form alone. Tautologies are always true but they don’t tell us much about the world. No knowledge about monopoly was required to determine that the statement was true. In fact, it is equally true that “If the moon is made of cheese, then Elvis is still alive, or if Elvis is still alive, then unicorns have 5 legs.”</div>
