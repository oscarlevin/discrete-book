<div class="para">We multiplied <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(-3x\)</span> which shifts every term over one spot and multiplies them by <span class="process-math">\(-3\text{.}\)</span> On the third line, we multiplied <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2x^2\text{,}\)</span> which shifted every term over two spots and multiplied them by 2. When we add up the corresponding terms, we are taking each term, subtracting 3 times the previous term, and adding 2 times the term before that. This will happen for each term after <span class="process-math">\(a_1\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(a_n - 3a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2} = 0\text{.}\)</span> In general, we might have two terms from the beginning of the generating series, although in this case the second term happens to be 0 as well.</div>
