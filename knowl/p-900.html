<div class="para">This is more than just an example of how we can use the multiplicative principle in a particular counting question. What we have here is a general interpretation of certain applications of the multiplicative principle using rigorously defined mathematical objects: functions. Whenever we have a counting question that asks for the number of outcomes of a repeated event, we can interpret that as asking for the number of functions from <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\ldots, n\}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is the number of times the event is repeated) to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,\ldots,k\}\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the number of ways that event can occur).</div>
