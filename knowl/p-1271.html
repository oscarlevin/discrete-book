<div class="para">It is almost NEVER okay to prove a statement with just an example. Certainly none of the statements proved above can be proved through an example. This is because in each of those cases we are trying to prove that something holds of all integers. We claim that <span class="process-math">\(n^2\)</span> being even implies that <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> is even, <em class="emphasis">no matter what integer</em> <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> we pick. Showing that this works for <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\)</span> is not even close to enough.</div>
