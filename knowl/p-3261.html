<div class="para">We could go on and on and on about different proof styles (we haven't even mentioned induction or combinatorial proofs here), but instead we will end with one final useful technique: proof by cases. The idea is to prove that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true by proving that <span class="process-math">\(Q \imp P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\neg Q \imp P\)</span> for some statement <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> So no matter what, whether or not <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> is true, we know that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is true. In fact, we could generalize this. Suppose we want to prove <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> We know that at least one of the statements <span class="process-math">\(Q_1, Q_2, \ldots, Q_n\)</span> is true. If we can show that <span class="process-math">\(Q_1 \imp P\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q_2 \imp P\)</span> and so on all the way to <span class="process-math">\(Q_n \imp P\text{,}\)</span> then we can conclude <span class="process-math">\(P\text{.}\)</span> The key thing is that we want to be sure that one of our cases (the <span class="process-math">\(Q_i\)</span>'s) must be true no matter what.</div>
