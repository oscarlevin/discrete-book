<div class="para">You might remember from calculus that this is only true on the interval of convergence for the power series, in this case when <span class="process-math">\(|x| \lt 1\text{.}\)</span> That is true for us, but we don't care. We are never going to plug anything in for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> so as long as there is some value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which the generating function and generating series agree, we are happy. And in this case we are happy.</div>
