<div class="para">The answer is not 37, even though the sum of the numbers above is 37. For example, while 12 students failed Algebra, 2 of those students also failed Biology, 6 also failed Chemistry, and 1 of those failed all three subjects. In fact, that 1 student who failed all three subjects is counted a total of 7 times in the total 37. To clarify things, let us think of the students who failed Algebra as the elements of the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> and similarly for sets <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> The one student who failed all three subjects is the lone element of the set <span class="process-math">\(A \cap B \cap C\text{.}\)</span> Thus, in Venn diagrams:</div>
