<div class="para">To give a combinatorial proof we need to think up a question we can answer in two ways: one way needs to give the left-hand-side of the identity, the other way needs to be the right-hand-side of the identity. Our clue to what question to ask comes from the right-hand side: <span class="process-math">\({n+2 \choose 3}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select 3 things from a group of <span class="process-math">\(n+2\)</span> things. Let's name those things <span class="process-math">\(1, 2, 3, \ldots, n+2\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we want to find 3-element subsets of those numbers (since order should not matter, subsets are exactly the right thing to think about). We will have to be a bit clever to explain why the left-hand-side also gives the number of these subsets. Here's the proof.</div>
