<div class="para">Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of in the codomain. The notation above works: <span class="process-math">\(f\inv(\{y\})\)</span> is the set of all elements in the domain that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> sends to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> It makes sense to think of this as a set: there might not be anything sent to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (if <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is not in the range), in which case <span class="process-math">\(f\inv(\{y\}) = \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> Or <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> might send multiple elements to <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> (if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not injective). As a notational convenience, we usually drop the set braces around the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and write <span class="process-math">\(f\inv(y)\)</span> instead for this set.</div>
