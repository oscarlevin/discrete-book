<div class="para">Why is this true? <span class="process-math">\({n \choose k}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> things from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. On the other hand, <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> counts the number of ways to select <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. Are these really the same? Well, what if instead of selecting the <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things you choose to exclude them. How many ways are there to choose <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things to exclude from <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> choices. Clearly this is <span class="process-math">\({n \choose n-k}\)</span> as well (it doesn't matter whether you include or exclude the things once you have chosen them). And if you exclude <span class="process-math">\(n-k\)</span> things, then you are including the other <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> things. So the set of outcomes should be the same.</div>
