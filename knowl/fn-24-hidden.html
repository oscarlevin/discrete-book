<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">The standard example for matchings used to be the <em class="emphasis">marriage problem</em> in which <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> consisted of the men in the town, <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> the women, and an edge represented a marriage that was agreeable to both parties. A matching then represented a way for the town elders to marry off everyone in the town, no polygamy allowed. We have chosen a more progressive context for the sake of political correctness.</div></body>
