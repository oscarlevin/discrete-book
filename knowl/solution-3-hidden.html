<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<div class="para">True. The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards. But consider the contrapositive: If you <em class="emphasis">don't</em> have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you don't have nine cards. It is easy to see why this is true: you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits, for a total of eight cards (or fewer).</div> <div class="para">The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit, then you have nine cards. This is false. You could have three spades and nothing else. Note that to demonstrate that the converse (an implication) is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true (you do have three cards of the same suit), but where the conclusion is false (you do not have nine cards).</div>
