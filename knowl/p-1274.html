<div class="para">So far we have gotten only primes. You might be tempted to conjecture, “For all positive integers <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> the number <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</span> is prime.” If you wanted to prove this, you would need to use a direct proof, a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof, but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples. In fact, we can prove this conjecture is <em class="emphasis">false</em> by proving its negation: “There is a positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(n^2 - n + 41\)</span> is not prime.” Since this is an existential statement, it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.</div>
