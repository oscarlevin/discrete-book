        <statement>
          <p>
            Write out all functions <m>f: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b\}</m> (using two-line notation). How many are there? How many are injective? How many are surjective? How many are both?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 8 different functions. In two-line notation these are:

            <p>
              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix}</me>
              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix}
              </me>
              <me>
                \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix} </me>

            </p>

            None of the functions are injective. Exactly 6 of the functions are surjective. No functions are both (since no functions here are injective).

        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 9 functions: you have a choice of three outputs for <m>f(1)</m>, and for each, you have three choices for the output <m>f(2)</m>. Of these functions, 6 are injective, 0 are surjective, and 0 are both:

            <me>
              f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{a\amp a} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{b \amp b} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{c \amp c}

              <li><m>f</m> is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain. Since <m>f(\{1\}) = 1</m> and <m>f(\{2\}) = 1</m>, we see that <m>f</m> is not injective.</li>
              <li><m>f</m> is not surjective. The largest subset of <m>A</m> is <m>A</m> itself, and <m>|A| = 10</m>. So no natural number greater than 10 will ever be an output.</li>
              <li><m>f\inv(1) = \{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}, \ldots \{10\}\}</m> (the set of all the singleton subsets of <m>A</m>).</li>

                    Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>. Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even, then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>. Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>, we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>. Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd, then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>. The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd (or visa-versa). But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even, so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>, which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

                    Let <m>y</m> be an element of the codomain <m>\Z</m>. We will show there is an element <m>n</m> of the domain (<m>\Z</m>) such that <m>f(n) = y</m>. There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>. Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd, so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired. Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>. Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even, so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as needed. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.

            At the end of the semester a teacher assigns letter grades to each of her students. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Yes, this is a function, if you choose the domain and codomain correctly. The domain will be the set of students, and the codomain will be the set of possible grades. The function is almost certainly not injective, because it is likely that two students will get the same grade. The function might be surjective <ndash /> it will be if there is at least one student who gets each grade.

            In the game of <em>Hearts</em>, four players are each dealt 13 cards from a deck of 52. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?

            Suppose 7 players are playing 5-card stud. Each player initially receives 5 cards from a deck of 52. Is this a function? If so, what sets make up the domain and codomain, and is the function injective, surjective, bijective, or neither?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This cannot be a function. If the domain were the set of cards, then it is not a function because not every card gets dealt to a player. If the domain were the set of players, it would not be a function because a single player would get mapped to multiple cards. Since this is not a function, it doesn't make sense to say whether it is injective/surjective/bijective.
