      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the next two terms in <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> beginning <m>3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85\ldots.</m>. Then give a recursive definition for the sequence. Finally, use the characteristic root technique to find a closed formula for the sequence.

          171 and 341. <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 5</m>. Closed formula: <m>a_n = \frac{8}{3}2^n + \frac{1}{3}(-1)^n</m>.  To find this solve the characteristic polynomial, <m>x^2 - x - 2</m>, to get characteristic roots <m>x = 2</m> and <m>x=-1</m>.  Then solve the system

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the recurrence relation <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 2^n</m> with <m>a_0 = 5</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>a_n = 3 + 2^{n+1}</m>.  We should use telescoping or iteration here.  For example, telescoping gives

            <mrow>a_2 - a_1 \amp = 2^2</mrow>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Show that <m>4^n</m> is a solution to the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We claim <m>a_n = 4^n</m> works. Plug it in: <m>4^n = 3(4^{n-1}) + 4(4^{n-2})</m>. This works - just simplify the right-hand side.
