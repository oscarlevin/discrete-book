            <li>

            <li>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            You break your piggy-bank to discover lots of pennies and nickels. You start arranging these in rows of 6 coins.
          <ol>
            <li> <p> You find yourself making rows containing an equal number of pennies and nickels.  For fun, you decide to lay out every possible such row.  How many coins will you need? </p> </li>
            <li> <p> How many coins would you need to make all possible rows of 6 coins (not necessarily with equal number of pennies and nickels)? </p> </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li> <p> We can think of each row as a 6-bit string of weight 3 (since of the 6 coins, we require 3 to be pennies).  Thus there are <m>{6 \choose 3} = 20</m> rows possible.  Each row requires 6 coins, so if we want to make all the rows at the same time, we will need 120 coins (60 of each). </p> </li>
              <li> <p> Now there are <m>2^6 = 64</m> rows possible, which is also <m>{6 \choose 0} + {6\choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + {6 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 4} + {6 \choose 5} + {6 \choose 6}</m>, if you break them up into rows containing 0, 1, 2, etc. pennies.  Thus we need <m>6 \cdot 64 = 384</m> coins (192 of each). </p> </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </solution>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How many 10-bit strings contain 6 or more 1's?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            <m>{10 \choose 6} + {10\choose 7} + {10\choose 8} + {10 \choose 9} + {10\choose 10} = 386</m> strings.  Count the number of strings with each permissible number of 1's separately, then add them up.
          </p>

        <statement>
          <p>
            How many subsets of <m>\{0,1,\ldots, 9\}</m> have cardinality 6 or more?
          </p>
        </statement>

      <exercise>
        <statement>
          <p>
            What is the coefficient of <m>x^{12}</m> in <m>(x+2)^{15}</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            To get an <m>x^{12}</m>, we must pick 12 of the 15 factors to contribute an <m>x</m>, leaving the other 3 to contribute a 2. There are <m>{15 \choose 12}</m> ways to select these 12 factors. So the term containing an <m>x^{12}</m> will be <m>{15 \choose 12}x^{12}2^{3}</m>. In other words, the coefficient of <m>x^{12}</m> is <m>{15\choose 12}2^3 = 3640</m>.
          </p>
        </solution>

            <ol>
              <li><m>{14 \choose 7} = 3432</m> paths.  The paths all have length 14 (7 steps up and 7 steps right), we just select which 7 of those 14 should be up.</li>
              <li><m>{6 \choose 2}{8\choose 5} = 840</m> paths.  First travel to (5,7), and then continue on to (10,10).</li>

            Gridtown USA, besides having excellent donut shoppes, is known for its precisely laid out grid of streets and avenues. Streets run east-west, and avenues north-south, for the entire stretch of the town, never curving and never interrupted by parks or schools or the like.
