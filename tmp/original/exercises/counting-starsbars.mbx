                A
                <term>multiset</term>
                is a collection of objects, just like a set, but can contain an object more than once (the order of the elements still doesn't matter). For example,
                <m>\{1,1, 2, 5, 5, 7\}</m>
                is a multiset of size 6.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many
                        <em>sets</em>
                        of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?

                        How many
                        <em>multi</em>sets of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?

                      <m>{10\choose 5}</m>
                      sets. We must select 5 of the 10 digits to put in the set.</li>

                          Use stars and bars: each star represents one of the 5 elements of the set, each bar represents a switch between digits. So there are 5 stars and 9 bars, giving us
                          <m>{14 \choose 9}</m>
                          sets.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Each of the counting problems below can be solved with stars and bars. For each, say what outcome the diagram
                <me>
                    ***|*||**|
                </me>
                represents, if there are the correct number of stars and bars for the problem. Otherwise, say why the diagram does not represent any outcome, and what a correct diagram would look like.
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many ways are there to select a handful of 6 jellybeans from a jar that contains 5 different flavors?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many ways can you distribute 5 identical lollipops to 6 kids?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        How many solutions are there to the equation
                        <m>x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 = 6</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
            <p>
              <ol>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          You take 3 strawberry, 1 lime, 0 licorice, 2 blueberry and 0 bubblegum.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          This is backwards. We don't want the stars to represent the kids because the kids are not identical, but the stars are. Instead we should use 5 stars (for the lollipops) and use 5 bars to switch between the 6 kids. For example, <me>**||***|||</me> would
                          represent the outcome with the first kid getting 2 lollipops, the third kid getting 3, and the rest of the kids getting none.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          This is the word AAAEOO.
                      </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                      <p>
                          This doesn't represent a solution. Each star should represent one of the 6 units that add up to 6, and the bars should
                          <em>switch</em>
                          between the different variables. We have one too many bars. An example of a correct diagram would be <me>*|**||***,</me> representing that
                          <m>x_1 = 1</m>,
                          <m>x_2 = 2</m>,
                          <m>x_3 = 0</m>, and
                          <m>x_4 = 3</m>.
                      </p>

                Using the digits 2 through 8, find the number of different 5-digit numbers such that:

                    <p>
                        Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. For example, 23678 is okay, but 32678 is not.

                        Digits
                        <em>can</em>
                        be repeated and must be written in
                        <em>non-decreasing</em>
                        order. For example, 24448 is okay, but 24484 is not.

                          numbers. We simply choose five of the seven digits and once chosen put them in increasing order.

                      <p>
                          This requires stars and bars. Use a star to represent each of the 5 digits in the number, and use their position relative to the bars to say what numeral fills that spot. So we will have 5 stars and 6 bars, giving
                          <m>{11 \choose 6}</m>
                          numbers.
