<title>Counting</title>


<introduction>
<p>
One of the first things you learn in mathematics is how to count. Now we want to count large collections of things quickly and precisely. For example:
<ul>
<li>
<p>
In a group of 10 people, if everyone shakes hands with everyone else exactly once, how many handshakes took place?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How many ways can you distribute <m>10</m> girl scout cookies to <m>7</m> boy scouts?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
How many anagrams are there of <q>anagram</q>?
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Before tackling questions like these, let's look at the basics of counting.
