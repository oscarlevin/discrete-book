<         In the time of Euler, in the town of K&#xf6;nigsberg in Prussia, there was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this question. Are you?

For the set <m>A = \{1,2,3,4,5\}</m>, we would use 5-bit strings, one bit for each element of <m>A</m>. Each bit in the string is a 0 if its corresponding element of <m>A</m> is not in the subset, and a 1 if the element of <m>A</m> is in the subset. Remember, deciding the subset amounted to a sequence of five yes/no votes for the elements of <m>A</m>. Instead of yes, we put a 1; instead of no, we put a 0.

<       <xref ref="sec_intro-statements" />, we see that for this to be true, either <m>P \imp Q</m> must be true or <m>Q \imp R</m> must be true (or both).

Luckily, we can make a chart to keep track of all the possibilities. Enter <term>truth tables</term>. The idea is this: on each row, we list a possible combination of T's and F's (for true and false) for each of the sentential variables, and then mark down whether the statement in question is true or false in that case. We do this for every possible combination of T's and F's. Then we can clearly see in which cases the statement is true or false. For complicated statements, we will first fill in values for each part of the statement, as a way of breaking up our task into smaller, more manageable pieces.

For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:

>     A <term>sequence</term><index><main>sequence</main></index> is simply an ordered list of numbers. For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <ellipsis/>. This is different from the set <m>\N</m> because, while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers, in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in. For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
320c318
<             <m>(3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots )</m>. These numbers are also doubling each time, but are also all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3   gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis />. Aha. We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

<             <m>(6, 10, 18, 34, 66, \ldots )</m>. To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>. Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m> (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>, not <m>2^0</m>). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, <ellipsis /> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>. Our sequence here would be twice this, so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as we got before.

<       What we did in the stamp example above works for many types of problems. Proof by induction is useful when trying to prove statements about all natural numbers, or all natural numbers greater than some fixed first case (like 28 in the example above), and in some other situations too. In particular, induction should be used when there is some way to go from one case to the next <ndash /> when you can see how to always <q>do one more.</q>

<       The previous example might remind you of the <em>racetrack principle</em> from calculus, which says that if <m>f(a) \lt  g(a)</m>, and <m>f'(x) \lt  g'(x)</m> for <m>x > a</m>, then <m>f(x) \lt  g(x)</m> for <m>x > a</m>. Same idea: the larger function is increasing at a faster rate than the smaller function, so the larger function will stay larger. In discrete math, we don't have derivatives, so we look at differences. Thus induction is the way to go.

<       As a final contrast between the two forms of induction, consider once more the stamp problem. Regular induction worked by showing how to increase postage by one cent (either replacing three 5-cent stamps with two 8-cent stamps, or three 8-cent stamps with five 5-cent stamps). We could give a slightly different proof using strong induction. First, we could show <em>five</em> base cases: it is possible to make 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 cents (we would actually say how each of these is made). Now assume that it is possible to make <m>k</m> cents of postage for all <m>k \lt  n</m> as long as <m>k \ge 28</m>. As long as <m>n > 32</m>, this means in particular we can make <m>k = n-5</m> cents. Now add a 5-cent stamp to get make <m>n</m> cents.
