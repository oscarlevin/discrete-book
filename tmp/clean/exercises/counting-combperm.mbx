                A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings.
              <ol>
                <li> <p> How many 3-topping pizzas could they put on their menu?  Assume double toppings are not allowed. </p> </li>

              <p>
                A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number, then to the left until you get to second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?
              </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
              <p>
                Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here. The order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are <m>P(40,3) = 40\cdot 39 \cdot 38</m> different possibilities for the <q>combination</q>. This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be <m>40^3</m>).

                <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated, but can come in any order. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. </p> </li>
                <li> <p> Which of the above counting questions is a combination and which is a permutation?  Explain why this makes sense. </p> </li>

                How many triangles are there with vertices from the points shown below? Note, we are not allowing degenerate triangles - ones with all three vertices on the same line, but we do allow non-right triangles. Explain why your answer is correct.

                <m>{7\choose 2}{7\choose 2} = 441</m> quadrilaterals. We must pick two of the seven dots from the top row and two of the seven dots on the bottom row.

                  <li> <p> 5 squares. You need to skip exactly one dot on the top and on the bottom to make the side lengths equal.  Once you pick a dot on the top, the other three dots are determined. </p> </li>

                An <em>anagram</em> of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of <q>uncopyrightable</q> are there? (This happens to be the longest common English word without any repeated letters.)

                After the first letter (a), we must rearrange the remaining 7 letters. There are only two letters (s and e), so this is really just a bit-string question (think of s as 1 and e as 0). Thus there <m>{7 \choose 2} = 21</m> anagrams starting with <q>a</q>.
