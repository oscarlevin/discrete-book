On day 4, you will have <m>12</m> mini bunnies (2 for each of the 6 large bunnies) plus 10 large bunnies (your previous 6 plus the 4 newly matured).

                Careful to actually use induction here. The base case: <m>2^2 = 4</m>. The inductive case: assume <m>(2n)^2</m> is divisible by 4 and consider <m>(2n+2)^2 = (2n)^2 + 4n + 4</m>. This is divisible by 4 because <m>4n +4</m> clearly is, and by our inductive hypothesis, so is <m>(2n)^2</m>.

        <solution>
          <p>
            Hint: there are two base cases <m>P(0)</m> and <m>P(1)</m>. Then, for the inductive case, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt  n</m>. This allows you to assume <m>a_{n-1} = 1</m> and <m>a_{n-2} = 1</m>. Apply the recurrence relation.

        <statement>

            Prove, using strong induction, that every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2. For example, <m>13 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Note that <m>1 = 2^0</m>; this is your base case. Now suppose <m>k</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>1\le k \le n</m>. We can then write <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 as follows: subtract the largest power of 2 less than <m>n</m> from <m>n</m>. That is, write <m>n = 2^j + k</m> for the largest possible <m>j</m>. But <m>k</m> is now less than <m>n</m>, and also less than <m>2^j</m>, so write <m>k</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 (we can do so by the inductive hypothesis). Thus <m>n</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement, <q>every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            <u>Base case</u>: Any set with 1 element <m>\{a\}</m> has exactly 2 subsets: the empty set and the set itself. Thus the number of subsets is <m>2= 2^1</m>. Thus <m>P(1)</m> is true.

            <u>Inductive case</u>: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. Thus every set containing exactly <m>k</m> elements has <m>2^k</m> different subsets. Now consider a set containing <m>k+1</m> elements: <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}</m>. Any subset of <m>A</m> must either contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> or not. In other words, a subset of <m>A</m> is just a subset of <m>\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_k\}</m> with or without <m>a_{k+1}</m>. Thus there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> and another <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which do not contain <m>a^{k+1}</m>. This gives a total of <m>2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m>. But our choice of <m>A</m> was arbitrary, so this works for any subset containing <m>k+1</m> elements, so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
