  <exercise>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you know that the statement <q>if Peter is not tall, then Quincy is fat and Robert is skinny</q> is <u>false</u>. What, if anything, can you conclude about Peter and Robert if you know that Quincy is indeed fat? Explain (you may reference
        <xref ref="tt">problem</xref>).
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Peter is not tall and Robert is not skinny. You must be in row 6 in the truth table above.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Are the statements <m>P \imp (Q \vee R)</m> and <m>(P \imp Q) \vee (P \imp R)</m> logically equivalent? Explain your answer.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Yes. To see this, make a truth table for each statement and compare.

        Notice that in every row for which both <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>P \imp R</m> is true, so is <m>P \imp (Q \wedge R)</m>. Therefore, whenever the premises of the argument are true, so is the conclusion. In other words, the deduction rule is valid.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the statement: for all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is even and <m>n \le 7</m> then <m>n</m> is negative or <m>n \in \{0,2,4,6\}</m>.

            Write the negation of the statement. Is it true? Explain.

          <p>
            The statement is true. If <m>n</m> is an even integer less than or equal to 7, then the only way it could not be negative is if <m>n</m> was equal to 0, 2, 4, or 6.

        <li>
          <p>
            For all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is not negative and <m>n \not\in\{0,2,4,6\}</m> then <m>n</m> is odd or <m>n &gt; 7</m>. This is true, since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement (which is true).

            For any number <m>x</m>, if it is the case that adding any number to <m>x</m> gives that number back, then multiplying any number by <m>x</m> will give 0.

            The converse in words is this: for any number <m>x</m>, if everything times <m>x</m> is zero, then everything added to <m>x</m> gives itself. Or in symbols: <m>\forall x (\forall z (x \cdot z = 0) \imp \forall y (x + y = y))</m>. The converse is true: the only number which when multiplied by any other number gives 0 is <m>x = 0</m>. And if <m>x = 0</m>, then <m>x + y = y</m>.

            The contrapositive in words is: for any number <m>x</m>, if there is some number which when multiplied by <m>x</m> does not give zero, then there is some number which when added to <m>x</m> does not give that number. In symbols: <m>\forall x (\exists z (x\cdot z \ne 0) \imp \exists y (x + y \ne y))</m>. We know the contrapositive must be true because the original implication is true.

            The negation: there is a number <m>x</m> such that any number added to <m>x</m> gives the number back again, but there is a number you can multiply <m>x</m> by and not get 0. In symbols: <m>\exists x (\forall y (x + y = y) \wedge \exists z (x \cdot z \ne 0))</m>. Of course since the original implication is true, the negation is false.

            Direct proof.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>n</m> be an integer. Assume <m>n</m> is odd. So <m>n = 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. Then
                <me>
                  7n = 7(2k+1) = 14k + 7 = 2(7k +3) + 1.
                </me>
              </p>

              <p>
                Since <m>7k + 3</m> is an integer, we see that <m>7n</m> is odd.

          <p>
            The converse is: for all integers <m>n</m>, if <m>7n</m> is odd, then <m>n</m> is odd. We will prove this by contrapositive.

            <proof>
              <p>
                Let <m>n</m> be an integer. Assume <m>n</m> is not odd. Then <m>n = 2k</m> for some integer <m>k</m>. So <m>7n = 14k = 2(7k)</m> which is to say <m>7n</m> is even. Therefore <m>7n</m> is not odd.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose you break your piggy bank and scoop up a handful of 22 coins (pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters).
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Prove that you must have at least 6 coins of a single denomination.

            Suppose you have an odd number of pennies. Prove that you must have an odd number of at least one of the other types of coins.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            How many coins would you need to scoop up to be sure that you either had 4 coins that were all the same or 4 coins that were all different? Prove your answer.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose you only had 5 coins of each denomination. This means you have 5 pennies, 5 nickels, 5 dimes and 5 quarters. This is a total of 20 coins. But you have more than 20 coins, so you must have more than 5 of at least one type.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose you have 22 coins, including <m>2k</m> nickels, <m>2j</m> dimes, and <m>2l</m> quarters (so an even number of each of these three types of coins). The number of pennies you have will then be
            <me>
              22 - 2k - 2j - 2l = 2(11-k-j-l)
            </me>
            But this says that the number of pennies is also even (it is 2 times an integer). Thus we have established the contrapositive of the statement, <q>If you have an odd number of pennies then you have an odd number of at least one other coin type.</q>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            You need 10 coins. You could have 3 pennies, 3 nickels, and 3 dimes. The 10th coin must either be a quarter, giving you 4 coins that are all different, or else a 4th penny, nickel or dime. To prove this, assume you don't have 4 coins that are all the same or all different. In particular, this says that you only have 3 coin types, and each of those types can only contain 3 coins, for a total of 9 coins, which is less than 10.
