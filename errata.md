# Errata for 3rd Edition

Many errors were fixed in preparation of the 3rd edition, but thanks in part to the careful reading by students and instructors, more have been revealed.  I'm releasing occasional fixes to the html, pdf and print versions.  These updates should not change the pagination in any major way.

If you use the html version, it will only contain errors listed in the first section below (and any undiscovered errors: please email me about them).

If you use a pdf or paperback version, check the copyright page for the printing date, which will tell you how far down this document you need to look for errors.

Page numbers match print and tablet pdf edition.

## Errors not yet corrected

### Major errors

* Exercise 1.5.3-c (page 108): The question should be "How many 6-letter words can you make using the 5 vowels *in alphabetical order*"

* Lemma 4.1.5 (page 240): The equation following this lemma is incorrect.  It should be $\sum_{v\in V} d(v) = 2e$.

### Minor typos and clarifications

* Exercise 1.7.2 (page 129): some of these can be made clearer.  For (i), the apples are identical.  For (j), assume each kid is allowed to choose one of the 4 varieties.  For (l) the numbers are distinct.  For (s), the teams are labeled (or have names, say "how many ways are there to add 11 kids to the 5 teams in your quidditch league, so that each team gets at least one of the 11 kids?").  For (t), we are looking for *integer* solutions.

* Exercise 2.1.17-c (page 146): the $p$ should be a $k$ to make this consistent with the statement of the problem.  (Solution manual also needs to be fixed.)

* Page 238, second paragraph: "subgroup" should be "subgraph".
* Exercise 4.1.11 (page 245): The numbers need to be positive integers here (and really should be larger than 1 to make the binomial coefficients make sense).

* Exercise 4.1.15 (page 246): The graphs must have at least two vertices for this to make sense.

* Page 269, Investigate!: To be a graph, it must be that E conflicts with C, and F conflicts with C and D, in addition to those listed.

## Errors Corrected for 2nd Printing: 3/24/19

In case you have a copy of the book printed prior to 3/24/19 (check copyright page), you will find the following errors that have since been corrected.  Minor typos are not included below, unless they might cause confusion.

* Example 0.4.1-3 (page 39): the table used $g(x)$ instead of $h(x)$.

* Example 1.3.5-2 solution (page 85): The answer is 2162160, but in the explanation, this number was incorrectly written 2192190 in two places.

* Example 2.1.4 solution (page 141): The sequence of triangular numbers was missing 10 between 6 and 15.

* Page 149, second paragraph after Example 2.2.1: The recursive definition for a geometric sequence had a_n on both sides.  It should be $a_n = a_{n-1}\cdot r$
