    <p permid="MRZ">
      A <term>sequence</term>
          <idx><h>sequence</h></idx>
      is simply an ordered list of numbers.
      For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <ellipsis/>.
      This is different from the set <m>\N</m> because,
      while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers,
      in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in.
      For this reason,
      when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
      <me permid="WlL">
        a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
      </me>.
      To refer to the <em>entire</em> sequence at once,
      we will write <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> or <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m>,
      or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just <m>(a_n)</m>
      (in which case we assume we start the sequence with <m>a_0</m>).
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>notation for</h></idx>
      <notation>
        <usage>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</usage>
        <description>the sequence <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots</m></description>
      </notation>

    </p>

    <p permid="sZi">
      We might replace the <m>a</m> with another letter,
      and sometimes we omit <m>a_0</m>, starting with <m>a_1</m>,
      in which case we would use
      <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> to refer to the sequence as a whole.
      The numbers in the subscripts are called <term>indices</term>
      (the plural of <term>index</term>).
    </p>

    <p permid="Zgr">
      <idx><h>sequence</h><h>as function</h></idx>
      While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers,
      it is really a type of function.
      Specifically, the sequence
      <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> is a function with domain <m>\N</m> where <m>a_n</m> is the image of the natural number <m>n</m>.
      Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus.
      We can shift a sequence up or down,
      add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence.
      These are done exactly as you would for functions.
    </p>

    <p permid="FnA">
      That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful,
      we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.

          you can calculate <m>a_n</m> directly:
          just plug in <m>n</m>.
          For example, to find <m>a_3</m> in the second sequence,

      You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences.
      After all, it is harder to find <m>a_n</m> with a recursive definition than with a closed formula.
      This is true,
      but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition.
      So to find a useful closed formula,
      we might first find the recursive definition,
      then use that to find the closed formula.
    </p>

    <p permid="dQk">
      This is not to say that recursive definitions aren't useful in finding <m>a_n</m>.
      You can always calculate <m>a_n</m> given a recursive definition,
      it might just take a while.

      <solution permid="uVz">
        <p permid="dgq">
          We know that <m>a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4</m>.
          So to find <m>a_6</m> we need to find <m>a_5</m> and <m>a_4</m>.
          Well
          <me permid="CsU">
            a_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2

          so if we can only find <m>a_3</m> and <m>a_2</m> we would be set.
          Of course
          <me permid="iAd">
            a_3 = 2a_2 - a_1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_2 = 2a_1 - a_0

          so we only need to find <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m>.
          But we are given these.

        <p permid="Jnz">
          Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence:
          <m>a_n = n+3</m>.
          To be sure this will always work,
          we could plug in this formula into the recurrence relation:
          <md permid="rTP">
            <mrow>2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \amp = 2((n-1) + 3) - ((n-2) + 3)</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="puI">
          That is not quite enough though,
          since there can be multiple closed formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation;
          we must also check that our closed formula agrees on the initial terms of the sequence.
          Since <m>a_0 = 0 + 3 = 3</m> and
          <m>a_1 = 1+3 = 4</m> are the correct initial conditions,
          we can now conclude we have the correct closed formula.

    <p permid="JXt">
      Finding closed formulas,
      or even recursive definitions,
      for sequences is not trivial.
      There is no one method for doing this.
      Just as in evaluating integrals or solving differential equations,
      it is useful to have a bag of tricks you can apply,
      but sometimes there is no easy answer.
    </p>

    <p permid="qeC">
      One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence for which we already know the closed formula.  To do this, we need a few <q>known sequences</q> to compare mystery sequences to.  Here are a few that are good to know.  We will verify the formulas for these in the coming sections.

                Note that if subtract 1 from each term,
                we get the sequence <m>(T_n)</m>.
                So we have <m>b_n = T_n + 1</m>.

                If we try this though, we get

                We are off because the indices are shifted.
                What we really want is <m>c_n = a_{n+1}+1</m> giving <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.

                What happens if we factor out a 2?
                We get <m>(T_n)</m>!
                More precisely, we find that <m>d_n/2 = T_n</m>,

                These are all triangular numbers.
                However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term.
                So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <m>T_n</m>,
                we would be set.
                Therefore the closed formula is
                <m>e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}</m> (where <m>n+3</m> came from <m>(n+2)+1</m>).
                Thinking about sequences as functions,
                we are doing a horizontal shift by 2:
                <m>e_n = T_{n+2}</m> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.

                Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2.
                You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term
                (the powers of 2 are <em>exactly</em>
                twice the previous term).

                These numbers are also doubling each time,
                but are also all multiples of 3.
                Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis/>.
                Aha.
                We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

                To get from one term to the next,
                we almost double each term.
                So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>.
                Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.
                So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m>
                (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>,
                not <m>2^0</m>).
                Alternatively,
                we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example:
                starting with 3, 5, 9, 17,
                <ellipsis/> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence.
                That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.
                Our sequence here would be twice this,
                so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as we got before.

                Try dividing each term by 3.
                That gives the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots</m>.
                Now add 1 to each term: <m>6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots</m>,
                which is <m>(d_n)</m> in this example,
                except starting with 6 instead of 0.
                So let's start with the formula <m>d_n= n(n+1)</m>.
                To start with the 6, we shift: <m>(n+2)(n+3)</m>.
                But this is one too many, so subtract 1:
                <m>(n+2)(n+3) - 1</m>.
                That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3.
                So we want <m>j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)</m>.
