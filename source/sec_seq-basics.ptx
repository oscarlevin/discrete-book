      <p>
        There is a monastery in Hanoi, as the legend goes, with a great hall containing three tall pillars.
        Resting on the first pillar were 64 giant disks (or washers), all different sizes, stacked from largest to smallest.
        The monks of the monastery have been moving the disks for generations, attempting to move the entire stack of disks to the third pillar.
        However, due to the size of the disks, the monks cannot move more than one at a time.
        Each disk must be placed on one of the pillars before the next disk is moved.
        And because the disks are so heavy and fragile, the monks may never place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.
        When the monks finally complete their task, the world shall come to an end.
      </p>

      
      <p>
        Your task: Figure out how long it will be before we need to start worrying about the end of the world.
      </p>
    </investigation>

    <p>
      This puzzle is called the <em>Tower of Hanoi</em>.
      <idx><h>Tower of Hanoi</h></idx>
      You are tasked with finding the minimum number of moves to complete the puzzle.
      This certainly sounds like a counting problem.
      Perhaps you have an answer? If not, what else could we try?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer to the puzzle depends on the number of disks you need to move.
      In fact, we could answer the puzzle first for 1 disk, then 2, then 3, and so on.
      If we list all of the answers for each number of disks, we will get a <term>sequence</term> of numbers.
      The <m>n</m>th term in the sequence is the answer to the question, <q>What is the smallest number of moves required to complete the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with <m>n</m> disks?</q> 
    </p>

    <p>
      Give it a try.  Find the smallest number of moves needed to transport the stack of <m>n</m> disks to another pillar, for different values of <m>n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might wonder why we would create such a sequence instead of just answering the question.
      By looking at how the sequence of numbers grows, we gain insight into the problem.
      It is easy to count the number of moves required for a small number of disks.
      We can then look for a pattern among the first few terms of the sequence.
      Hopefully this will suggest a method for finding the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence, which is the answer to our question.
      Of course we will also need to verify that our suspected pattern is correct, and that this correct pattern really does give us the <m>n</m>th term that we think it does, but it is impossible to prove that your formula is correct without having a formula to start with.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we will explore how to represent sequences of numbers in various ways, and two sorts of formulas that can be used to describe the sequence.  We will see that sequences are also interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right.

                To find the smallest number of moves required to transport 5 disks to another pillar, let's try to relate this task to the task of moving 4 disks.  How many moves do each of the following tasks require?
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Move the 4 smallest disks to the second pillar: <var name="15" width="5"/> moves.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Move the largest disk to the third pillar: <var name="1" width="5"/> moves.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>
                      Move the 4 smallest disks to the third pillar (on top of the largest disk): <var name="15" width="5"/> moves.
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, the smallest number of moves required to move five disks  is: <var name="31" width="5"/>

    <title>Sequences and Formulas</title>


    <p>
      A <term>sequence</term>
      <idx> <h>sequence</h> </idx>
      is simply an ordered list of numbers.
      Unlike a <em>set</em> of numbers, the order of the numbers in a sequence is an essential characteristic of the sequence.
      For this reason, when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
      <me>
        a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
      </me>.
      To refer to the <em>entire</em> sequence at once, we will write <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> or <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m>, or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just <m>(a_n)</m> (in which case we assume we start the sequence with <m>a_0</m>).
      <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>notation for</h> </idx>
      <notation>
        <usage> <m>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</m> </usage>
        <description>
          the sequence <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots</m>
        </description>
      </notation>
    </p>

    <p>
      We might replace the <m>a</m> with another letter, and sometimes we omit <m>a_0</m>, starting with <m>a_1</m>, in which case we would use <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> to refer to the sequence as a whole.
      The numbers in the subscripts are called <term>indices</term> (the plural of <term>index</term>).
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>as function</h> </idx>
      While we often just think of a sequence as an ordered list of numbers, it is really a type of function.
      Specifically, the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> is a function with domain <m>\N</m> where <m>a_n</m> is the image of the natural number <m>n</m>.
      Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus.
      We can shift a sequence up or down, add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence.
      These are done exactly as you would for functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful, we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Can you find the next term in the following sequences?
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol cols="2">
            <li>
              <m>7,7,7,7,7, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>3, -3, 3, -3, 3, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 5, 2, 10, 3, 15, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>3, 2, 1, 0, -1, \ldots</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1, 1, 2, 6, \ldots</m>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          No, you cannot.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          You might guess that the next terms are:
          <ol cols="5">
            <li>
              <m>7</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>-3</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>4</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                64
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                49
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                34
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                28
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                17
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>-2</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>24</m>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
          In fact, those are the next terms of the sequences I had in mind when I made up the example, but there is no way to be sure they are correct.
        </p>

        <p>
          Still, we will often do this.
          Given the first few terms of a sequence, we can ask what the pattern in the sequence suggests the next terms are.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Given that no number of initial terms in a sequence is enough to say for certain which sequence we are dealing with, we need to find another way to specify a sequence.
      We consider two main ways to do this:
    </p>

    <definition>
      <title>Closed formula</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>closed formula</term>
        <idx> <h>closed formula</h> </idx>
        <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>closed formula for</h> </idx>
        for a sequence <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> is a formula for <m>a_n</m> using a fixed finite number of operations on <m>n</m>.
        This is what you normally think of as a formula in <m>n</m>, just as if you were defining a function in terms of <m>n</m> (because that is exactly what you are doing).
      </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>

    <definition>
      <title>Recursive definition</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>recursive definition</term>
        <idx> <h>recursive definition</h> </idx>
        <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>recursive definition for</h> </idx>
        <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>inductive definition for</h> </idx>
        (sometimes called an <term>inductive definition</term>) for a sequence <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> consists of a <term>recurrence relation</term>
        <idx> <h>recurrence relation</h> </idx>
        : an equation relating a term of the sequence to previous terms (terms with smaller index), and an <term>initial condition</term>:
        <idx> <h>initial condition</h> </idx>
        a list of a few terms of the sequence (one less than the number of terms in the recurrence relation).
      </p>
    </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Here are a few closed formulas for sequences:
          <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>closed formula for</h> </idx>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <m>a_n = n^2</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>\d a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>\d a_n = \frac{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt 5}{2}\right)^n - \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt 5}{2}\right)^{-n}}{\sqrt{5}}</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Note in each formula, if you are given <m>n</m>, you can calculate <m>a_n</m> directly: Just plug in <m>n</m>.
          For example, to find <m>a_3</m> in the second sequence, just compute <m>a_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Here are a few recursive definitions for sequences:
          <idx> <h>sequence</h> <h>recursive definition for</h> </idx>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 27</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 0</m> and <m>a_1 = 1</m>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          In these formulas, if you are given <m>n</m>, you cannot calculate <m>a_n</m> directly; you first need to find <m>a_{n-1}</m> (or <m>a_{n-1}</m> and <m>a_{n-2}</m>).
          In the second sequence, to find <m>a_3</m> you would take <m>2a_2</m>, but to find <m>a_2 = 2a_1</m> we would need to know <m>a_1 = 2a_0</m>.
          We do know this, so we could trace back through these equations to find <m>a_1 = 54</m>, <m>a_2 = 108</m> and finally <m>a_3 = 216</m>.

      You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences.
      After all, it is harder to find <m>a_n</m> with a recursive definition than with a closed formula.
      This is true, but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition.
      So to find a useful closed formula, we might first find the recursive definition, and then use that to find the closed formula.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="eg-rice">
      <statement>
        <p>
          For defeating the evil dragon, the king promises you a reward of one grain of rice on the first day, and then twice as many grains the next day as the previous day, for the rest of the month.  
        </p>

        <p>
          Not to be swindled, you barter and get him to agree to add one additional grain of rice each day as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          How many grains of rice will you receive on the 30th day?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can write down the first few terms of the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> that gives the number of grains of rice you receive on day <m>n</m>.  We get
          <me>
            1, 3, 7, 15, \ldots
          </me>,
          since, for example, on day 4, you take the number of grains of rice you had on day 3 (all seven of them), double that and add 1, to get 15.  The next day you would get <m>2 \cdot 15 + 1 = 31</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          By actually computing these values, we see right away what the recurrence relation is:
          <me>
            a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1
          </me>.
          This is justified because the problem the sequence is modeling says that we double the number of grains each day, and then add 1.  We can read the recurrence relation right off the problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          The original question asked about <m>a_{30}</m>.  We could find this using the recurrence relation, but we would first need to find <m>a_{29}</m>, and to find that we would need <m>a_{28}</m>, which requires <m>a_{27}</m> first, and so on.  While I'm sure we could work all the way back to <m>a_4</m>, which we already found, this sounds like a lot of work.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would be so much nicer to have a closed formula.  If we could <em>solve the recurrence relation</em> and find that closed formula, we could just substitute <m>30</m> for <m>n</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's guess.  It looks like the sequence is close to <m>2, 4, 8, 16,\ldots</m> which has closed formula <m>2^n</m>.  That sequence has terms one greater than the terms in our sequence, so we might guess that <me>a_n = 2^n - 1</me>. To be clear, we have no good reason to believe this guess is correct, but maybe later in this chapter we will.  However, if it <em>is</em> correct, then we are golden (and incredibly sick of rice):
          <me>
            a_{30} = 2^{30} - 1 = 1,073,741,823
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      This is not to say that recursive definitions aren't useful in finding <m>a_n</m>.
      You can always calculate <m>a_n</m> given a recursive definition; it might just take a while.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find <m>a_6</m> in the sequence defined by <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          We know that <m>a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4</m>.
          So to find <m>a_6</m> we need to find <m>a_5</m> and <m>a_4</m>.
          Well
          <me>
            a_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2
          </me>,
          so if we can only find <m>a_3</m> and <m>a_2</m>, we would be set.
          Of course
          <me>
            a_3 = 2a_2 - a_1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_2 = 2a_1 - a_0
          </me>,
          so we only need to find <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m>.
          But we are given these.
          Thus
          <md>
            <mrow>a_0 \amp = 3</mrow>
            <mrow>a_1 \amp = 4</mrow>
            <mrow>a_2 \amp = 2\cdot 4 - 3 = 5</mrow>
            <mrow>a_3 \amp = 2\cdot 5 - 4 = 6</mrow>
            <mrow>a_4 \amp = 2\cdot 6 - 5 = 7</mrow>
            <mrow>a_5 \amp = 2\cdot 7 - 6 = 8</mrow>
            <mrow>a_6 \amp = 2\cdot 8 - 7 = 9</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence: <m>a_n = n+3</m>.
          To be sure this will always work, we could plug in this formula into the recurrence relation:
          <md>
            <mrow>2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \amp = 2((n-1) + 3) - ((n-2) + 3)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2n + 4 - n - 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = n + 3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = a_n</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That is not quite enough though, since there can be multiple closed formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation; we must also check that our closed formula agrees on the initial terms of the sequence.
          Since <m>a_0 = 0 + 3 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 1+3 = 4</m> are the correct initial conditions, we can now conclude that we have the correct closed formula.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Finding closed formulas, or even recursive definitions, for sequences is not trivial.
      There is no one method for doing this.
      Just as in evaluating integrals or solving differential equations, it is useful to have a bag of tricks you can apply, but sometimes there is no easy answer.
    </p>

    <p>
      One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence for which we already know the closed formula.
      To do this, we need a few <q>known sequences</q> to compare mystery sequences to.
      Here are a few that are good to know.
      We will verify the formulas for these in the coming sections.

          We wish to compare these sequences to the triangular numbers <m>(0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,\ldots)</m>, when we start with <m>n=0</m>, and the powers of 2: <m>(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots)</m>.

                <m>(3, 5, 9, 17, 33, \ldots )</m>. Each term in this sequence is one more than a power of 2, so we might guess the closed formula is <m>c_n = a_n+1 = 2^n + 1</m>. If we try this though, we get <m>c_0 = 2^0 + 1 = 2</m> and <m>c_1 = 2^1 + 1 = 3</m>. We are off because the indices are shifted. What we really want is <m>c_n = a_{n+1}+1</m> giving <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.

                Notice that all these terms are even.
                What happens if we factor out a 2? We get <m>(T_n)</m>! More precisely, we find that <m>d_n/2 = T_n</m>, so this sequence has closed formula <m>d_n = n(n+1)</m>.

              <p>
                <m>(3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, \ldots)</m>. These are all triangular numbers. However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term. So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <m>T_n</m>, we would be set. Therefore the closed formula is <m>e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}</m> (where <m>n+3</m> came from <m>(n+2)+1</m>). Thinking about sequences as functions, we are doing a horizontal shift by 2: <m>e_n = T_{n+2}</m> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.

              <p>
                <m>(0, 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, \ldots )</m>. Try adding 1 to each term, and we get powers of 2. You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term (the powers of 2 are <em>exactly</em> twice the previous term). Closed formula: <m>f_n = 2^{n} - 1</m>.

                <m>(3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots )</m>. These numbers are also doubling each time, but are also all multiples of 3. Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis />. Aha. We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

              <p>
                <m>(6, 10, 18, 34, 66, \ldots )</m>. To get from one term to the next, we almost double each term. So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>. Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2. So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m> (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>, not <m>2^0</m>). Alternatively, we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example: Starting with 3, 5, 9, 17, <ellipsis /> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence. That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>. Our sequence here would be twice this, so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as what we got before.

              <p>
                <m>(15, 33, 57, 87, 123, \ldots)</m>. Try dividing each term by 3. That gives the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots</m>. Now add 1 to each term: <m>6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots</m>, which is <m>(d_n)</m> in this example, except starting with 6 instead of 0. So let's start with the formula <m>d_n= n(n+1)</m>. To start with the 6, we shift: <m>(n+2)(n+3)</m>. But this is one too many, so subtract 1: <m>(n+2)(n+3) - 1</m>. That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3. So we want <m>j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)</m>.

          since the total number of push-ups done after <m>n</m> days will be the number done after <m>n-1</m> days, plus the number done on day <m>n</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          For something closer to a closed formula, we could write
          <me>
            b_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n
          </me>,
          or the same thing using <em>summation notation</em>:
          <me>
            b_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i
          </me>.
          <idx> <h>summation notation</h> </idx>
          <idx> <h>Sigma notation</h> </idx>
          However, note that these are not really closed formulas since even if we had a formula for <m>a_n</m>, we would still have an increasing number of computations to do as <m>n</m> increases.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Given any sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</m>, we can always form a new sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \in \N}</m> by
      <me>
        b_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n
      </me>.
      Since the terms of <m>(b_n)</m> are the sums of the initial part of the sequence <m>(a_n)</m>, we call <m>(b_n)</m> the <term>sequence of partial sums of <m>(a_n)</m></term>.
      <idx> <h>sequence of partial sums</h> </idx>
      <idx> <h>partial sums</h> <see>sequence of partial sums</see> </idx>
      Soon we will see that it is sometimes possible to find a closed formula for <m>(b_n)</m> from the closed formula for <m>(a_n)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To simplify writing out these sums, we will often use notation like <m>\d\sum_{k=1}^n a_k</m>.
      This means add up the <m>a_k</m>'s where <m>k</m> changes from 1 to <m>n</m>.
      <idx> <h>summation notation</h> </idx>
      <idx> <h>Sigma notation</h> </idx>
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use <m>\sum</m> notation to rewrite the sums:
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \cdots + 100</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \cdots + 2^{50}</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>6 + 10 + 14 + \cdots + (4n - 2)</m>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          <ol cols="3">
            <li>
              <m>\d\sum_{k=1}^{100} k</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^{50} 2^k</m>
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>\d\sum_{k=2}^{n} (4k -2)</m>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <!-- <p>
      If we want to multiply the <m>a_k</m> instead, we could write <m>\d\prod_{k=1}^n a_k</m>.
      For example, <m>\d\prod_{k=1}^n k = n!</m>.
      <idx> <h>product notation</h> </idx>
    </p> -->

    <p>
      It is also often useful to look at the <term>sequence of difference</term> of a sequence <m>(a_{n})</m>.  By this we just mean the sequence <m>(d_n)</m> where 
      <me>
        d_n = a_{n+1} - a_{n}
      </me>.
      For example, if <m>(a_n) = (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, \ldots)</m> (the square numbers, so <m>a_n = n^2</m>), then the sequence of differences is <m>(d_n) = (3, 5, 7, 9, \ldots)</m> since <m>4-1 = 3</m>, <m>9-4 = 5</m>, and so on.  We could also find a closed formula for the sequence of differences here since we have a closed formula for <m>a_n</m>.  We would have
      <me>
        d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n = (n+1)^2 - n^2 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2 = 2n+1
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, it is easy to go from a closed formula for a sequence to a closed formula for the sequence of differences.  It is not always easy to go the other way around.  In fact, what would it look like to start with a sequence of differences and get the <q>original</q> sequence?  
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking about a recurrence relation is helpful here.  Since <me>d_n = a_{n+1} - a_n</me>,
      we have that <me>a_{n+1} = a_n + d_n</me>.  This makes sense: to get from one term of a sequence to the next, you add the difference between those terms.  Ah!  You add the differences.  So the <alert>original sequence is the sequence of partial sums of the sequence of differences!</alert>
    </p>

    <p>
      In upcoming sections we will see that understanding the sequence of differences can tell us exactly where to look for a closed formula.  The differences also suggest how to create a recursive definition.
    </p>
    
    <example>
      <idx><h>recurrence relation</h><h>finding for sequence</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find a recurrence relation and initial conditions that agree with the terms of this sequence: <m>1, 5, 17, 53, 161, 485\ldots</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Finding the recurrence relation would be easier if we had some context for the problem
          (like the Tower of Hanoi, for example).
          Alas, we have only the sequence.
          Remember, the recurrence relation tells you how to get from previous terms to future terms.
          What is going on here?
          We could look at the differences between terms:
          <m>4, 12, 36, 108, \ldots</m>.
          Notice that these are growing by a factor of 3.
          Is the original sequence as well? <m>1\cdot 3 = 3</m>,
          <m>5 \cdot 3 = 15</m>, <m>17 \cdot 3 = 51</m> and so on.
          It appears that we always end up with 2 less than the next term.
          Aha!
        </p>
  
        <p>
          So <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 2</m> is our recurrence relation and the initial condition is <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>

    <title>Sequences in python</title>

    <p>
      Checking that a closed formula agrees with the initial terms in a sequence is easy with a calculator, or better yet, a programming language like python.
      One way you can do this is to define a function that returns the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example: Suppose you wanted to check whether a formula you found for the sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \in \N} = (1, 3, 7, 15, 31,\ldots)</m> is correct.
      Perhaps you guess that <m>a_n = 2^n-1</m>.
      Try running the code below.
      (Note: In python, the <c>^</c> symbol means something else, so to do exponentiation, we use <c>**</c>.)
    </p>


    <program interactive="activecode" language="python" label="a-n-seq1">
      <input>
def a(n):
  return 2**n-1
print(a(3))
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      Looks promising, but we should be careful: Our sequence started with <m>a_0 = 1</m>, which makes <m>a_3 = 15</m>.
      Now try modifying the definition of <c>a(n)</c> (by changing the return value) to get the correct closed formula.
    </p>

    <p>
      Perhaps you want to print out the first 20 terms of the sequence? This is easy to do with python, by putting the terms in a list:
    </p>


    <program interactive="activecode" language="python" label="a-n-seq1-list">
      <input>
def a(n):
  return 2**(n+1) - 1
sequence = []
for n in range(20):
  sequence.append(a(n))
print(sequence)
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      Note that <c>range(20)</c> starts at 0 and stops at 19 (it is the list <c>[0,1,2,...,19]</c>).
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also use python to generate terms for a sequence given a recursive definition.
      Suppose we wanted to explore the sequence <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}+1</m> with initial condition <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
      In python, we could generate the sequence as follows.
    </p>


    <program interactive="activecode" language="python" label="req-a-n">
      <input>
def a(n):
  if n == 0:
    return 1
  else:
    return 2*a(n-1)+1
# just print out the first 10 terms
for i in range(10):
  print(a(i))
      </input>
    </program>

    <p>
      Do you see how to translate a recurrence relation into a recursive python function? Try playing around with the code above to explore other sequences.
