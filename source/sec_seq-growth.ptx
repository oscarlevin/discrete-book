              A sequence of three dot patterns, labeled n = 0, n = 1, and n = 2, from left to right.
              The first pattern contains two dots, on above the other.
              The second pattern can be viewed as each of the dots from the first pattern splitting into 3, forming two triangles (so six dots total).
              The third patter again takes each dot from the second pattern and splits them into three, arranged as triangles (so 18 dots in total).

            <description>
              A sequence of four dot patters, labeled n = 1 through n = 4.
              The first pattern is a single dot.
              The second adds a row of two dots below the single dot (so three dots in a triangle).
              The third pattern adds a row of three dots, creating six dots arranged in a triangle.
              Finally we add four dots below the previous six, still forming a triangle, this time of 10 dots.

    <p>
      Our goal is to find closed formulas for sequences.
      Our primary strategy will be to first determine how the sequence is changing from term to term.
      This will lead to a recurrence relation for the sequence, and from that recurrence relation, we will find a closed formula.
      We start with two types of sequences that are particularly common and useful: arithmetic and geometric sequences.
      Along the way, we will explore some techniques for solving recurrence relations.

    <title>Arithmetic Sequences</title>

    <p>
      Suppose you start a business selling prints of mathematical art.
      In week zero, you sell two prints.
      Each week after that, you sell four more prints than you did the previous week.
      How many prints will you sell in the <m>n</m>th week?
    </p>

    <p>
      We can easily compute the first few terms of the sequence: <m>2, 6, 10, 14,\ldots</m>.
      How do I know this is correct?  From the problem, we see that to get from one term to the next, we must add 4.
      It is clear then that the recurrence relation for the sequence is
      <me>
        a_n = a_{n-1} + 4
      </me>.
      The <em>rate of growth</em> for the sequence is the constant <m>4</m> since the <em>difference</em> between any two terms is 4 (note, we could write the recurrence relation as <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 4</m>).
    </p>

    <p>
      We call sequences with a <em>constant rate of change</em> <term>arithmetic sequences</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now let's find a closed formula for our sequence.
      The first term is <m>a_0 = 2</m>.
      To get <m>a_1</m>, we add <m>4</m>.
      The next term requires us to add <m>4</m> again, which means we have added <m>4</m> to our initial term twice.
      Then we add <m>4</m> again, for a total of three times for <m>a_3</m>.
      In fact, to get <m>a_n</m>, we will have added <m>4</m> to <m>a_0</m> a total of <m>n</m> times.
      Thus, the closed formula for the sequence is
      <me>
        a_n = 2 + 4n
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This works for any arithmetic sequence.
      That is, any sequence with a constant difference will have a <em>linear</em> closed formula, where the <q>slope</q> of the linear function is the common difference.
    </p>

      <idx><h>arithmetic sequence</h></idx>
      <idx><h>recursive definition</h><h>for arithmetic sequence</h></idx>
      <idx><h>common difference</h></idx>
      <idx><h>closed formula</h><h>for arithmetic sequence</h></idx>
      <p>
        If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant, we say the sequence is <term>arithmetic</term>.
        If the initial term (<m>a_0</m>) of the sequence is <m>a</m> and the <term>common difference</term> is <m>d</m>, then we have,
      </p>

      <p>
        Recursive definition: <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + d</m> with <m>a_0 = a</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Closed formula: <m>a_n = a + dn</m>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      As we did for our example above, for the recursive definition, we need to specify <m>a_0</m>.
      Then we need to express <m>a_n</m> in terms of <m>a_{n-1}</m>.
      If we call the first term <m>a</m>, then <m>a_0 = a</m>.
      For the recurrence relation, by the definition of an arithmetic sequence, the difference between successive terms is some constant, say <m>d</m>.
      So <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = d</m>, or in other words,
      <me>
        a_0 = a \qquad a_n = a_{n-1} + d
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's now argue why the closed formula is correct.  One way we could do this is by using a technique sometimes called <term>telescoping</term> (a name which hopefully we become meaningful momentarily).
    </p>

    <p>
      We write the recurrence relation in its <em>difference</em> form, <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = d</m> for all terms starting with <m>a_1</m> and going up to <m>a_n</m>.  This gives the following:
      <md>
        <mrow>a_1 - a_0 = \amp d</mrow>
        <mrow>a_2 - a_1 = \amp d</mrow>
        <mrow>a_3 - a_2 = \amp d</mrow>
        <mrow>\vdots  \amp </mrow>
        <mrow>a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = \amp d</mrow>
        <mrow>a_n - a_{n-1} =  \amp d</mrow>
      </md>.
      Now we add all <m>n</m> equations together.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      On the right-hand side, we have added <m>d</m> to itself <m>n</m> times, so the sum is <m>d\cdot n</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left-hand side, we get the sum:
      <me>
        (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots + (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}) + (a_n - a_{n-1})
      </me>.
      But look what happens when we regroup and cancel like terms:
      <me>
        \cancel{a_1} - a_0 + \cancel{a_2} - \cancel{a_1} + \cancel{a_3} - \cancel{a_2} + \cdots + \cancel{a_{n-1}} - \cancel{a_{n-2}} + a_n - \cancel{a_{n-1}} = a_n - a_0
      </me>.
      The sum <em>telescopes</em> down to be nice and compact for easy storage.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting the two sides together gives us <me>a_n - a_0 = d \cdot n</me> which becomes <me>a_n = a_0 + d \cdot n</me> as we claimed.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      The telescoping we did above is useful in other contexts (see <xref ref="ex-telescoping-sum"/>), but now that we have established a general form of the closed formula, we can apply it to any arithmetic sequence.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find recursive definitions and closed formulas for the arithmetic sequences below.
          Assume the first term listed is <m>a_0</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \ldots</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <m>50, 43, 36, 29, \ldots</m>.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          First we should check that these sequences really are arithmetic by taking differences of successive terms.
          Doing so will reveal the common difference <m>d</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>5-2 = 3</m>, <m>8-5 = 3</m>, etc. To get from each term to the next, we add three, so <m>d = 3</m>. The recursive definition is therefore <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 3</m> with <m>a_0 = 2</m>. The closed formula is <m>a_n = 2 + 3n</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                Here the common difference is <m>-7</m>, since we add <m>-7</m> to 50 to get 43, and so on.
                Thus we have a recursive definition of <m>a_n = a_{n-1} - 7</m> with <m>a_0 = 50</m>.
                The closed formula is <m>a_n = 50 - 7n</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </solution>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-geometric-sequences">
    <title>Geometric Sequences</title>

    <p>
      What about sequences like <m>3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots</m>? This is not arithmetic because the difference between terms is not constant.
      However, the <em>ratio</em> between successive terms is constant: <m>\frac{6}{3} = \frac{12}{6} = \frac{24}{12} = \cdots = 2</m>
      We call such sequences <term>geometric</term>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Recognizing that the sequence is geometric lets us easily write down a recursive definition.  <m>a_n = 2 a_{n-1}</m>, with <m>a_0 = 3</m>.  
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A closed formula is also not difficult to reason out.  How do we get the term <m>a_3</m> for example?  We start with <m>3</m>, then multiply by 2 to get <m>a_1</m>, multiply by <m>2</m> again to get <m>a_2</m>, and multiply by <m>2</m> a third time to get <m>a_3</m>.  So we multiplied <m>3</m> by <m>2</m> a total of three times, or <m>a_3 = 3\cdot 2^3</m>.  It looks like <m>a_n = 3\cdot 2^n</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In general, the recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term <m>a</m> and common ratio <m>r</m> will be <me>a_n = a_{n-1}\cdot r; a_0 = a</me>.
      To get the next term we multiply the previous term by <m>r</m>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For the general closed formula, we could try something like telescoping again, although we would need to cancel fractions.  Instead, let's illustrate another technique for solving recurrence relations called <term>iteration</term>. The idea here is that we work our way up to <m>a_n</m> and notice the pattern. 
      Write
      <md>
        <mrow>a_0 \amp = a</mrow>
        <mrow>a_1 \amp = a_0\cdot r</mrow>
        <mrow>a_2 \amp = a_1 \cdot r = a_0\cdot r\cdot r = a_0\cdot r^2</mrow>
        <mrow>a_3 \amp = a_2 \cdot r = a_0 \cdot r^2 \cdot r = a_0 \cdot r^3</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp \vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>a_n \amp = a_{n-1} \cdot r = a_0 \cdot r^{n-1}\cdot r = a_0 r^n</mrow>
      </md>.
      We must multiply the first term <m>a</m> by <m>r</m> a number of times, <m>n</m> times to be precise.
      We get <m>a_n = a\cdot r^{n}</m>.

        A sequence is called <term>geometric</term> if the ratio between successive terms is constant.
        Suppose the initial term <m>a_0</m> is <m>a</m> and the <term>common ratio</term> is <m>r</m>.

              <m>3, 6, 12, 24, 48, \ldots</m>

          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Start by checking that these sequences really are geometric by dividing each term by its previous term.
          If this ratio really is constant, we will have found <m>r</m>.
          <ol>
            <li>
              <m>6/3 = 2</m>, <m>12/6 = 2</m>, <m>24/12 = 2</m>, etc. Yes, to get from any term to the next, we multiply by <m>r = 2</m>. So the recursive definition is <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m>. The closed formula is <m>a_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The common ratio is <m>r = 1/3</m>.
                So the sequence has recursive definition <m>a_n = \frac{1}{3}a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 27</m> and closed formula <m>a_n = 27\cdot \frac{1}{3}^{n}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Geometric sequences are those which have a growth rate that is <em>proportional</em> to the sequence itself.
      Just like you might have seen in calculus, it is exactly the exponential functions that have this property.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the examples and formulas above, we assumed that the <em>initial</em> term was <m>a_0</m>.
      If your sequence starts with <m>a_1</m>, you can easily find the term that would have been <m>a_0</m> and use that in the formula.
      For example, if we want a formula for the sequence <m>2, 5, 8,\ldots</m> and insist that <m>2= a_1</m>, then we can find <m>a_0 = -1</m> (since the sequence is arithmetic with common difference 3, we have <m>a_0 + 3 = a_1</m>).
      Then the closed formula will be <m>a_n = -1 + 3n</m>.
    </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        If you look at other sources, you might find that their closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences differ from ours.
        Specifically, you might find the formulas <m>a_n = a +(n-1)d</m> (arithmetic) and <m>a_n = a\cdot r^{n-1}</m> (geometric).
        Which is correct? Both! In our case, we take <m>a</m> to be <m>a_0</m>.
        If instead we had <m>a_1</m> as our initial term, we would get the (slightly more complicated) formulas you find elsewhere.

    <p>
      Is this sequence arithmetic?
      No, since <m>3-1 = 2</m> and <m>6-3 = 3 \ne 2</m>,
      so there is no common difference.
      Is the sequence geometric?
      No. <m>3/1 = 3</m> but <m>6/3 = 2</m>,
      so there is no common ratio.
      What to do?
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the <em>differences</em> between terms <em>do</em> form an arithmetic sequence:
      <m>2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\ldots</m>.  In other words, the rate of change of this sequence is arithmetic: <m>T_n - T_{n-1} = n</m>, which immediately gives us the recurrence relation <m>T_n = T_{n-1} + n</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Another way to think of this is that the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence <m>(T_n)</m> is the <em>sum</em>
      of the first <m>n</m> terms in the sequence <m>1,2,3,4,5,\ldots</m>.
      Thus <m>(T_n)</m> is the
      <term>sequence of partial sums</term>
<idx><h>sequence of partial sums</h><h>for triangular numbers</h></idx>
      of the sequence <m>1,2,3,\ldots</m>
      (<em>partial</em> sums because we are not taking the sum of all infinitely many terms).
    </p>

    <p>
      This should become clearer if we expand the recurrence relation to write the triangular numbers like this:
      <md>
        <mrow>T_1 = 1 \amp = 1</mrow>
        <mrow>T_2 = 3 \amp = 1+2</mrow>
        <mrow>T_3 = 6 \amp = 1 + 2 + 3</mrow>
        <mrow>T_4 = 10 \amp = 1+ 2 + 3+ 4</mrow>
        <mrow>\vdots \amp \qquad \vdots</mrow>
        <mrow>T_n \amp = 1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</mrow>
      </md>.
      We are really using <em>iteration</em> here.  We could also have seen this by using telescoping, taking <m>T_0 = 0</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>T_1-T_0  = \amp 1</mrow>
        <mrow>T_2 - T_1 = \amp 2</mrow>
        <mrow>T_3 - T_2 =  \amp 3</mrow>
        <mrow>\vdots \amp </mrow>
        <mrow>T_n - T_{n-1} = \amp n</mrow>
      </md>.
      Summing these equations, the right-hand side becomes <m>1+2+3+\cdots + n</m>; the left-hand side cancels to leave just <m>T_n - T_0 = T_n</m>.
    </p>

    

    <p>
      If we know how to add up the terms of an arithmetic sequence,
      we can find a closed formula for a sequence whose differences are the terms of that arithmetic sequence.
      Consider how we could find the sum of the first 100 positive integers
      (that is, <m>T_{100}</m>).
      Instead of adding them in order,
      we regroup and add <m>1+100 = 101</m>.
      The next pair to combine is <m>2+99 = 101</m>.
      Then <m>3+98 = 101</m>.
      Keep going.
      This gives 50 pairs which each add up to <m>101</m>,
      so <m>T_{100} = 101\cdot 50 = 5050</m>.<fn>
      This insight is usually attributed to Carl Friedrich Gauss,
      one of the greatest mathematicians of all time,
      who discovered it as a child when his unpleasant elementary teacher thought he would keep the class busy by requiring them to compute the lengthy sum.
      </fn></p>

    <p>
      In general, using this same sort of regrouping,
      we find that <m>T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.
      Incidentally,
      this is exactly the same as <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m>,
      which makes sense if you think of the triangular numbers as counting the number of handshakes that take place at a party with <m>n+1</m> people:
      the first person shakes <m>n</m> hands,
      the next shakes an additional <m>n-1</m> hands and so on.
    </p>
    

    <p>
      The point of all of this is that some sequences,
      while not arithmetic or geometric,
      can be interpreted as the sequence of partial sums of arithmetic and geometric sequences.
      Luckily there are methods we can use to compute these sums quickly, which we will explore in the next two sections.

    <title>Solving recurrence relations</title>

    <p>
      We have seen that it is often easier to find recursive definitions than closed formulas.
      Lucky for us, there are a few techniques for converting recursive definitions to closed formulas.
      Doing so is called <term>solving a recurrence relation</term>.
      Recall that the recurrence relation is a recursive definition without the initial conditions.
      For example, the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence
      <idx><h>Fibonacci sequence</h><h>recurrence relation</h></idx>
      is <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m>.
      (This, together with the initial conditions <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m> give the entire recursive <em>definition</em> for the sequence.)
    </p>

    <p>
      We are going to try to <em>solve</em> these recurrence relations.
      By this we mean something very similar to solving differential equations: we want to find a function of <m>n</m> (a closed formula) which satisfies the recurrence relation, as well as the initial condition.<fn> Recurrence relations are sometimes called difference equations since they can describe the difference between terms and this highlights the relation to differential equations further.
      </fn> Just like for differential equations, finding a solution might be tricky, but checking that the solution is correct is easy.
      <idx><h>difference equation</h><see>recurrence relation</see></idx>
    </p>

    <example>
      <idx><h>recurrence relation</h><h>verifying solution to</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Check that <m>a_n = 2^n + 1</m> is a solution to the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} - 1</m> with <m>a_1 = 3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          First, it is easy to check the initial condition: <m>a_1</m> should be <m>2^1 + 1</m> according to our closed formula.
          Indeed, <m>2^1 + 1 = 3</m>, which is what we want.
          To check that our proposed solution satisfies the recurrence relation, try plugging it in.
          <md>
            <mrow>2a_{n-1} - 1 \amp = 2(2^{n-1} + 1) - 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2^n + 2 - 1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 2^n +1</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = a_n</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what our recurrence relation says! We have a solution.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Sometimes we can be clever and solve a recurrence relation by inspection.
      We generate the sequence using the recurrence relation and keep track of what we are doing so that we can see how to jump to finding just the <m>a_n</m> term.
      Here are two examples of how you might do that.
    </p>

    <p>
      <term>Telescoping</term>
      <idx><h>telescoping</h></idx>
      refers to the phenomenon when many terms in a large sum cancel out<mdash/>so the sum <q>telescopes.</q> For example:
      <me>
        (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) + (4 - 3) + \cdots + (100 - 99) + (101 - 100) = -1 + 101
      </me>
      because every third term looks like: <m>2 + -2 = 0</m>, and then <m>3 + -3 = 0</m> and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can use this behavior to solve recurrence relations.
      Here is an example.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the recurrence relation <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + n</m> with initial term <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          To get a feel for the recurrence relation, write out the first few terms of the sequence: <m>4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 19, \ldots</m>.
          Look at the difference between terms.
          <m>a_1 - a_0 = 1</m> and <m>a_2 - a_1 = 2</m> and so on.
          The key thing here is that the difference between terms is <m>n</m>.
          We can write this explicitly: <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = n</m>.
          Of course, we could have arrived at this conclusion directly from the recurrence relation by subtracting <m>a_{n-1}</m> from both sides.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now use this equation over and over again, changing <m>n</m> each time:
          <md>
            <mrow>a_1 - a_0 \amp = 1</mrow>
            <mrow>a_2 - a_1 \amp = 2</mrow>
            <mrow>a_3 - a_2 \amp = 3</mrow>
            <mrow>\vdots \quad \amp \quad \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>a_n - a_{n-1} \amp = n</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Add all these equations together.
          On the right-hand side, we get the sum <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.
          We already know this can be simplified to <m>\frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m>.
          What happens on the left-hand side? We get
          <me>
            (a_1 - a_0) + (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots (a_{n-1} - a_{n-2})+ (a_n - a_{n-1})
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This sum telescopes.
          We are left with only the <m>-a_0</m> from the first equation and the <m>a_n</m> from the last equation.
          Putting this all together we have <m>-a_0 + a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}</m> or <m>a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + a_0</m>.
          But we know that <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
          So the solution to the recurrence relation, subject to the initial condition is
          <me>
            a_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 4
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          (Now that we know that, we should notice that the sequence is the result of adding 4 to each of the triangular numbers.)
          <idx><h>triangular numbers</h></idx>
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      The above example shows a way to solve recurrence relations of the form <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + f(n)</m> where <m>\sum_{k = 1}^n f(k)</m> has a known closed formula.
      If you rewrite the recurrence relation as <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = f(n)</m>, and then add up all the different equations with <m>n</m> ranging between 1 and <m>n</m>, the left-hand side will always give you <m>a_n - a_0</m>.
      The right-hand side will be <m>\sum_{k = 1}^n f(k)</m>, which is why we need to know the closed formula for that sum.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, telescoping will not help us with a recursion such as <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 2</m> since the left-hand side will not telescope.
      You will have <m>-3a_{n-1}</m>'s but only one <m>a_{n-1}</m>.
      However, we can still be clever if we use <term>iteration</term>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have already seen an example of iteration when we found the closed formula for arithmetic and geometric sequences.
      The idea is, we <em>iterate</em>
      <idx><h>iteration</h></idx>
      the process of finding the next term, starting with the known initial condition, up until we have <m>a_n</m>.
      Then we simplify.
      In the arithmetic sequence example, we simplified by multiplying <m>d</m> by the number of times we add it to <m>a</m> when we get to <m>a_n</m>, to get from <m>a_n = a + d + d + d + \cdots + d</m> to <m>a_n = a + dn</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To see how this works, let's go through the same example we used for telescoping, but this time use iteration.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use iteration to solve the recurrence relation <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + n</m> with <m>a_0 = 4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Again, start by writing down the recurrence relation when <m>n = 1</m>.
          This time, don't subtract the <m>a_{n-1}</m> terms to the other side:
          <me>
            a_1 = a_0 + 1
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now <m>a_2 = a_1 + 2</m>, but we know what <m>a_1</m> is.
          By substitution, we get
          <me>
            a_2 = (a_0 + 1) + 2
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now go to <m>a_3 = a_2 + 3</m>, using our known value of <m>a_2</m>:
          <me>
            a_3 = ((a_0 + 1) + 2) + 3
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          We notice a pattern.
          Each time, we take the previous term and add the current index.
          So
          <me>
            a_n = ((((a_0 + 1) +2)+3)+\cdots + n-1) + n
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regrouping terms, we notice that <m>a_n</m> is just <m>a_0</m> plus the sum of the integers from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>.
          So, since <m>a_0 = 4</m>,
          <me>
            a_n = 4 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Of course in this case we still needed to know formula for the sum of <m>1,\ldots,n</m>.
      Let's try iteration with a sequence for which telescoping doesn't work.
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Solve the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 2</m> subject to <m>a_0 = 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Again, we iterate the recurrence relation, building up to the index <m>n</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>a_1 \amp = 3a_0 + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>a_2 \amp = 3(a_1) + 2 = 3(3a_0 + 2) + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>a_3 \amp = 3[a_2] + 2 = 3[3(3a_0 + 2) + 2] + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>\vdots \amp \qquad \vdots \qquad \qquad \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>a_n \amp = 3(a_{n-1}) + 2 = 3(3(3(3\cdots(3a_0 + 2) + 2) + 2)\cdots + 2)+ 2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is difficult to see what is happening here because we have to distribute all those 3's.
          Let's try again, this time simplifying a bit as we go.
          <md>
            <mrow>a_1 \amp = 3a_0 + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>a_2 \amp = 3(a_1) + 2 = 3(3a_0 + 2) + 2 = 3^2a_0 + 2\cdot 3 + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>a_3 \amp = 3[a_2] + 2 = 3[3^2a_0 + 2\cdot 3 + 2] + 2 = 3^3 a_0 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2</mrow>
            <mrow>\vdots \amp \qquad\quad \vdots \hspace{2in} \vdots</mrow>
            <mrow>a_n \amp = 3(a_{n-1}) + 2 = 3(3^{n-1}a_0 + 2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + \cdots +2)+ 2</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp \qquad \qquad = 3^n a_0 + 2\cdot 3^{n-1} + 2 \cdot 3^{n-2} + \cdots + 2\cdot 3 + 2</mrow>
          </md>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now we simplify.
          <m>a_0 = 1</m>, so we have <m>3^n + \langle\text{stuff}\rangle</m>.
          Note that all the other terms have a 2 in them.
          In fact, we have a geometric sum with first term <m>2</m> and common ratio <m>3</m>.
          We have seen how to simplify <m>2 + 2\cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + \cdots + 2\cdot 3^{n-1}</m>.
          We get <m>\frac{2-2\cdot 3^n}{-2}</m> which simplifies to <m>3^n - 1</m>.
          Putting this together with the first <m>3^n</m> term gives our closed formula:
          <me>
            a_n = 2\cdot 3^n - 1
          </me>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      <idx><h>iteration</h></idx>
      Iteration can be messy, but when the recurrence relation only refers to one previous term (and maybe some function of <m>n</m>) it can work well.
      However, trying to iterate a recurrence relation such as <m>a_n = 2 a_{n-1} + 3 a_{n-2}</m> will be way too complicated.
      We would need to keep track of two sets of previous terms, each of which were expressed by two previous terms, and so on.
      The length of the formula would grow exponentially (double each time, in fact).
      Luckily there happens to be a method for solving recurrence relations which works very well on relations like this.
