      <idx>permutation</idx>
      A <term>permutation</term> is a (possible) rearrangement of objects.
      For example,
      there are 6 permutations of the letters <em>a, b, c</em>:
      <me permid="LLg">
        abc, ~~ acb, ~~ bac, ~~bca, ~~ cab, ~~ cba
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="qdc">
      We know that we have them all listed above
      <mdash/>there are 3 choices for which letter we put first,
      then 2 choices for which letter comes next,
      which leaves only 1 choice for the last letter.
      The multiplicative principle says we multiply <m>3\cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.
    </p>

    <example permid="WFK">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ACh">
          How many permutations are there of the letters
          <em>a, b, c, d, e, f</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="HwM">
        <p permid="eUd">
          We do NOT want to try to list all of these out.
          However, if we did,
          we would need to pick a letter to write down first.
          There are 6 choices for that letter.
          For each choice of first letter,
          there are 5 choices for the second letter
          (we cannot repeat the first letter;
          we are rearranging letters and only have one of each),
          and for each of those,
          there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter.
          So there are <m>6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720</m> permutations of the 6 letters.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="Wkl">
      A piece of notation is helpful here:
      <m>n!</m>, read <q><m>n</m> factorial</q>,
          <idx><h>factorial</h></idx>
      is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to <m>n</m>
      (for reasons of convenience, we also define 0! to be 1).
      So the number of permutation of 6 letters,
      as seen in the previous example is <m>6! = 6\cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.
      This generalizes:

      <statement>
        <p permid="gJq">
          How many functions <m>f:\{1,2,\ldots,8\} \to \{1,2,\ldots, 8\}</m> are <em>bijective</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="nDV">
        <p permid="Lbm">
          Remember what it means for a function to be bijective:
          each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one element of the domain.
          Using two-line notation, we could write one of these bijections as
          <me permid="rSp">
            f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8} {3 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4}
          </me>.
          What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the codomain,
          so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements.
          In fact, <q>permutation</q> is another term used to describe bijective functions from a finite set to itself.
        </p>

        <p permid="riv">
          If you believe this,
          then you see the answer must be <m>8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot\cdots\cdot 1 = 40320</m>.
          You can see this directly as well:
          for each element of the domain,
          we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to map to.
          There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for where to send 2, and so on.
          We multiply using the multiplicative principle.

      Sometimes we do not want to permute all of the letters/numbers/elements we are given.

          can you make from the letters <em>a</em>

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="TLe">
        <p permid="XpE">
          This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters,
          only now we have more choices for each letter.
          For the first letter, there are 6 choices.
          For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second letter.
          Then there are 4 choices for the third letter,
          and 3 choices for the last letter.
          The total number of words is <m>6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360</m>.
          This is not <m>6!</m> because we never multiplied by 2 and 1.
          We could start with <m>6!</m> and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write <m>\frac{6!}{2!}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="iyD">
      <idx><h>permutation</h><h sortby="of k elements chosen from

      <idx><h sortby="k-permutation of n elements"><m>k</m>-permutation of <m>n</m> elements</h></idx>
      In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of <m>k</m> objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of <m>n</m> objects.
      (In the example above, <m>k = 4</m>, and <m>n = 6</m>.)
      We write this number <m>P(n,k)</m> and sometimes call it a
      <term><m>k</m>-permutation of <m>n</m> elements</term>.
      From the example above,
      we see that to compute <m>P(n,k)</m> we must apply the multiplicative principle to <m>k</m> numbers,
      starting with <m>n</m> and counting backwards.
      For example
      <me permid="XZy">
        P(10, 4) = 10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="OFM">
      Notice again that <m>P(10,4)</m> starts out looking like <m>10!</m>,
      but we stop after 7.
      We can formally account for this <q>stopping</q>
      by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want:
      <me permid="EgH">
        P(10,4) = \frac{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10!}{6!}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="uMV">
      Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not <m>4!</m> but rather <m>(10-4)!</m>.

          there are no surjections).
          But for a function to be injective,

      Here is another way to find the number of <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements:
      first select which <m>k</m> elements will be in the permutation,

      Once you have selected the <m>k</m> objects,
      we know there are <m>k!</m> ways to arrange (permute) them.
      But how do you select <m>k</m> objects from the <m>n</m>?
      You have <m>n</m> objects, and you need to
      <em>choose</em> <m>k</m> of them.
      You can do that in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
      Then for each choice of those <m>k</m> elements,
      we can permute <em>them</em> in <m>k!</m> ways.

      there is just an extra <m>k!</m> in the denominator of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
      That extra <m>k!</m> accounts for the fact that
      <m>{n \choose k}</m> does not distinguish between the different orders that the <m>k</m> objects can appear in.
      We are just selecting
      (or choosing)
      the <m>k</m> objects, not arranging them.
      Perhaps <q>combination</q> is a misleading label.
      We don't mean it like a combination lock

      Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors

          In fact, we can say exactly how much larger <m>P(14,6)</m> is.
          In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends.

          To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:

          This is a reasonable guess,

          But the guess is wrong (in fact,
          that product is exactly <m>2162160 = P(14,6)</m>).
          It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests.
          To correct for this,
          we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests
          (so that all of these would count as just one outcome).
          There are precisely <m>6!</m> ways to arrange 6 guests,
          so the correct answer to the first question is
          <me permid="oXJ">
            \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="UuY">
          Note that another way to write this is
          <me permid="VeS">
            \frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!}
          </me>.
          which is what we had originally.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
