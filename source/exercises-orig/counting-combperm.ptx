            A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it.
            To open the lock,
            you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number,
            then to the left until you get to second number,
            then to the right again to the third number.
            The numbers must be distinct.

            Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here.
            The order in which the three numbers appears matters.

            This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers

                  This is just the multiplicative principle.
                  There are 7 digits which we can select for each of the 5 positions,
                  so we have
                  <m>7^5 = 16807</m>
                  such numbers.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  Now we have 7 choices for the first number, 6 for the second, etc.
                  So there are
                  <m>7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = P(7,5) = 2520</m>
                  such numbers.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  To build such a number we simply must select 5 different digits.
                  After doing so,
                  there will only be one way to arrange them into a 5-digit number.
                  Thus there are
                  <m>{7 \choose 5} = 21</m>
                  such numbers.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  The permutation is in part (b),
                  while the combination is in part (c).
                  At first this seems backwards,
                  since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter.
                  Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter.
                  The better way to
                  distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes.
                  In part (c),
                  there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits,
                  while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives
                  <m>5!</m>
                  different outcomes.

            First, decide where to put the <q>a</q>s.
            There are 7 positions,
            and we must choose 3 of them to fill with an <q>a</q>.
            This can be done in <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways.
            The remaining 4 spots all get a different letter,
            so there are <m>4!</m> ways to finish off the anagram.
            This gives a total of <m>{7 \choose 3}\cdot 4!</m> anagrams.
            Strangely enough, this is 840,
            which is also equal to <m>P(7,4)</m>.
            To get the answer that way,
            start by picking one of the 7 <em>positions</em>
            to be filled by the <q>n</q>,
            one of the remaining 6 positions to be filled by the <q>g</q>,

            one of the remaining 4 positions to be filled by the <q>m</q>

            An <em>anagram</em> of a word is a rearrangement of its letters

            We do not need the anagram to form an English word.

                  There are <m>120 = 5!</m> anagrams.
                  We can pick any of the 5 distinct letters to put first,
                  then any of the remaining 4, and so on.
                  We could also have written this <m>P(5,5)</m>.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We need to place 5 a's, 2 b's, 2 r's, and one each of c and d.
                  So first select 5 of the eleven slots for the a's, which can be done in <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> ways.
                  Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.
                  Next pick 2 of the remaining 4 slots of r's, in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways,
                  and finally pick one of the two available spots for the c leaving the last for the d.
                  Thus all together the number of anagrams is:
                  <me>
                    {11\choose 5}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}2\cdot 1 = 83160
                  </me>.
                  (Note, if you pick a different letter to start with,
                  you get a different looking answer,
                  but the final product should be the same.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another approach: Think of all of the letters as different
                  (so there are 5 a's, but maybe written in 5 different fonts,
                  for example.)
                  In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.
                  Now to correct for the repeated letters,
                  group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.
                  Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams
                  (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).
                  We just need to count groups, so the total is
                  <me>
                    \frac{11!}{5!2! 2!} = 83160
                  </me>.
                </p>

                  We already know there are 120 5-letter sub-anagrams.
                  To find the 4-letter sub-anagrams,
                  we need to pick one of 5 letters first, then one of remaining,
                  then one of 3 after that and one of the remaining 2.
                  Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well
                  (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).
                  There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams,
                  <m>5\cdot 4 = 20</m> 2-letter sub-anagrams,
                  and <m>5</m> 1-letter sub-anagrams.
                  All together, this brings the number of sub-anagrams to
                  <me>
                    120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 = 325
                  </me>.

                  How many of the injective functions are <em>increasing</em>?
                  To be increasing means that if <m>a \lt b</m> then <m>f(a) \lt f(b)</m>,
                  or in other words, the outputs get larger as the inputs get larger.

        We have seen that the formula for <m>P(n,k)</m> is <m>\dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m>.
        Your task here is to explain <em>why</em>
        this is the right formula.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose you have 12 chips, each a different color.
              How many different stacks of 5 chips can you make?
              Explain your answer and why it is the same as using the formula for <m>P(12,5)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Using the scenario of the 12 chips again,
              what does <m>12!</m> count?
              What does <m>7!</m> count?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why it makes sense to divide <m>12!</m> by <m>7!</m> when computing <m>P(12,5)</m>
              (in terms of the chips).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and 5?
              Explain the formula <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> using the variables <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>.
