    <statement>
      <p>
        A bipartite graph that doesn't have a matching might still have a
        <term>partial matching</term>.
        By this we mean a set of <em>edges</em>
        for which no vertex belongs to more than one edge
        (but possibly belongs to none).
        Every bipartite graph
        (with at least one edge)
        has a partial matching,
        so we can look for the largest partial matching in a graph.

      <p>
        Your <q>friend</q> claims that she has found the largest partial matching for the graph below
        (her matching is in bold).
        She explains that no other edge can be added,
        because all the edges not used in her partial matching are connected to matched vertices.
        Is she correct?

    <statement>
      <p>
        One way you might check to see whether a partial matching is maximal is to construct an
        <term>alternating path</term>.
        This is a sequence of adjacent edges,
        which alternate between edges in the matching and edges not in the matching
        (no edge can be used more than once).
        If an alternating path starts and stops with an edge
        <em>not</em> in the matching,
        then it is called an <term>augmenting path</term>.

        For many applications of matchings,
        it makes sense to use bipartite graphs.
        You might wonder, however,
        whether there is a way to find matchings in graphs in general.

            Prove that if a graph has a matching,

          <li>
            Is the converse true?
            That is, do all graphs with
            <m>\card{V}</m> even have a matching?
          </li>

          <li>
            What if we also require the matching condition?
            Prove or disprove: If a graph with an even number of vertices satisfies
            <m>\card{N(S)} \ge \card{S}</m> for all <m>S \subseteq V</m>,
            then the graph has a matching.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
