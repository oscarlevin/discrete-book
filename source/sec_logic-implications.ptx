			<statement>
				<p>
					Little Timmy's Mom tells him, <q>If you don't eat all your broccoli, then you will not get any ice cream.</q>  Of course, Timmy loves his ice cream, so he quickly eats all his broccoli (which actually tastes pretty good).

				<p>
					After dinner, when Timmy asks for his ice cream, he is told no!  Does Timmy have a right to be upset?  Why or why not?

		<p>
			By far, the most important type of statement in mathematics is the implication.  It is also the least intuitive of our basic molecular statement types.  Our goal in this section is to become more familiar with this key concept.
		</p>

		<p>
			<idx><h>Pythagorean theorem</h></idx>
			To see why this sort of statement is so prevalent, consider the <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em>.  Despite what social media might claim, the Pythagorean Theorem is not <me>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</me>.  Okay, sure, that has a variable in it, so we must be using the convention to take the universal generalization,
			<me>
				\forall a,b,c \in \R \left( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \right)
			</me>.
			 So <m>1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2</m>???  Okay, fine.  The equation is true as long as <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the length of the hypotenuse.  In other words:
		</p>
			 <blockquote>
				<p>
					<em>If</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>c</m>, <em>then</em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.
				</p>
			 </blockquote>
			 <p>
				Math is about making general claims, but a claim is rarely going to be true of absolutely <em>every</em> mathematical object.  The way we <em>restrict</em> our claims to a particular type of object is with an implication: <q>Take any object you like, <em>if</em> it is of the right type, <em>then</em> this thing is true about it.</q>
			 </p>

			 <p>
				Similarly, as we saw in the <xref ref="subsec_logic-statements-quant" text="title"/> subsection, when we make claims like <q>Every square is a rectangle,</q> we really have an implication: <q>If something is a square, then it is a rectangle.</q> 
			 </p>

			 <p>
				Here is a reminder of what we mean by an implication.
			 </p>
		<definition>
			<title>Implication</title>
			<idx><h>implication</h></idx>
			<idx><h>conditional</h></idx>
			<idx><h>antecedent</h><see>hypothesis</see></idx>
			<idx><h>consequent</h><see>conclusion</see></idx>
			<idx>hypothesis</idx>
			<idx>conclusion</idx>
			<statement>
			<p>
				An <term>implication</term> (or <term>conditional</term>)
				is a molecular statement of the form
				<me>
					P \imp Q
				</me>
				where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are statements.
				We say that
				<ul>
					<li>
						<m>P</m> is the <term>hypothesis</term>
						(or <term>antecedent</term>).
					</li>

					<li>
						<m>Q</m> is the <term>conclusion</term>
						(or <term>consequent</term>).
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				An implication is <em>true</em>
				provided <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m> is true
				(or both),
				and <em>false</em> otherwise.
				In particular, the only way for
				<m>P \imp Q</m> to be false is for <m>P</m> to be true
				<em>and</em> <m>Q</m> to be false.
			</p>
		</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			The definition of truth of an implication can also be represented as a truth table:
		</p>

		<figure xml:id="fig-implication-tt">
			<caption>The truth table for <m>P \imp Q</m>.</caption>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<col right="minor"/> <col right="major"/> <col/>
				<row bottom="minor">
					<cell><m>P</m></cell> <cell><m>Q</m></cell> <cell><m>P \imp Q</m></cell>
				</row>
			<row>
				<cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>T</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell> <cell>T</cell>
			</row>
			<row>
				<cell>F</cell> <cell>F</cell> <cell>T</cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>
	</figure>
		
	<p>
		Does this truth table make sense?  Should we believe it?  Look in particular at the third row: F, T, T, and consider the implication, <q>If <m>5 \lt 3</m> then <m>5+3 = 8</m>.</q>  Does that statement <em>
		feel</em> true?  The truth table says it should be (since <m>5 \lt 3</m> is false, and <m>5+3 = 8</m> is true).
	</p>

	<p>
		Much of what we will do in the remainder of this section is convince ourselves that this truth table makes sense.

	<subsection xml:id="subsec_implications">
		<title>Understanding the Truth Table</title>

		<p>
			The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts.
			Our definition of the truth conditions for an implication says that there is only one way for an implication to be false: when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.  
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the statement:
				</p>

				<blockquote>
					<p>
						If Bob gets a 90 on the final,
						then Bob will pass the class.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<p>
					This is definitely an implication:
					<m>P</m> is the statement <q>Bob gets a 90 on the final,</q>
					and <m>Q</m> is the statement <q>Bob will pass the class.</q>
				</p>

				<p>
					Suppose I made that statement to Bob.
					In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar?
					What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final,
					and he did pass the class?
					Then I have not lied; my statement is true.
					However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class,
					then I lied, making the statement false.
					The tricky case is this: What if Bob did not get a 90 on the final?
					Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't.
					Did I lie in either case?
					I think not.
					In these last two cases,
					<m>P</m> was false, and the statement <m>P \imp Q</m> was true.
					In the first case, <m>Q</m> was true,
					and so was <m>P \imp Q</m>.
					So <m>P \imp Q</m> is true when either <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m> is true.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</example>

		<p>
			Just to be clear,
			although we sometimes read <m>P \imp Q</m> as <q> <m>P</m>
			<em>implies</em> <m>Q</m> </q>,
			we are not insisting that there is some <em>causal</em> relationship between the statements <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> (although there might be).
			<q>If <m>x \lt y</m>, then <m>x+1 \lt y+1</m>,</q> is a true statement (or at least, its universal generalization is).  We know it is true because we understand how the two parts interact.  If you add 1 to two numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then their order does not change.  But the statement, <q>if <m>1 \lt 2</m>, then Euclid studied geometry</q> is also a true implication.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Decide which of the following statements are true and which are false.
					Briefly explain.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								If <m>1=1</m>, then most horses have 4 legs.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								If <m>0=1</m>, then <m>1=1</m>.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								If 8 is a prime number, then the 7624th digit of
								<m>\pi</m> is an 8.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								If the 7624th digit of <m>\pi</m> is an 8, then <m>2+2 = 4</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					All four of the statements are true.
					Remember, the only way for an implication to be false is for the
					<em>if</em> part to be true and the
					<em>then</em> part to be false.
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Here both the hypothesis and the conclusion are true,
								so the implication is true.
								It does not matter that there is no meaningful connection between the true mathematical fact and the fact about horses.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Here the hypothesis is false and the conclusion is true,
								so the implication is true.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								I have no idea what the 7624th digit of <m>\pi</m> is,
								but this does not matter.
								Since the hypothesis is false,
								the implication is automatically true.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Regardless of the truth value of the hypothesis,
								the conclusion is true, making the implication true.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			This is a strange example and isn't really how we use implications anyway.  This strangeness is not just mathematicians being stubborn though.  The truth conditions for implications <em>must</em> be like they are for mathematics to make sense.  Let's see why.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the statement, <q>All squares are rectangles,</q> which can also be phrased as, <q>For all shapes, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle.</q>  Is this statement true or false?  Are we sure?  What about the following three shapes?
				</p>
				<image width="75%">
					<shortdescription>three shapes, a square, a non-square rectangle, and a triangle.</shortdescription>
					<latex-image label="img-squares">
						\begin{tikzpicture}
							\draw (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
							\draw (3,0) rectangle (6,1.5);
							\draw (7,0) -- (8,0) -- (9,2) -- cycle;
						\end{tikzpicture}
					</latex-image>
				</image>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Of course the statement is true.  A square is a 4-sided plane figure with 4 right angles and 4 equal-length sides, while a rectangle is a 4-sided plane figure with 4 right angles.  
				</p>

				<p>
					However, what we mean when we consider a universal statement like this is that, no matter what we <q>plug in</q> for the variable (<q>the shape</q> in this case), the resulting statement is true.  When the statement is about a particular shape, we have an implication <m>P \imp Q</m>.  This means it must be true that, if the actual shape on the left is a square, then it is a rectangle.  Great.  The shape is a square (<m>P</m> is true) and is a rectangle (<m>Q</m> is true), so yes, the implication is true.
				</p>

				<p>
					Is the implication true of the rectangle in the middle?  Well, that shape is not a square (<m>P</m> is false), and it is a rectangle (<m>Q</m> is true).  But look, we believe that all squares are rectangles, so the statement must be true.  Even of a rectangle.  The only way this works is if <q>false implies true</q> is true!
				</p>

				<p>
					Similarly, all squares are rectangles is a true statement, even when we look at a triangle.  <m>P</m> is false (the triangle is not a square), and <m>Q</m> is false (the triangle is not a rectangle).  Thankfully, we defined implications to be true in this case as well.
				</p>

				<p>
					We have given shapes that illustrate lines 1, 3, and 4 of the truth table for implications (<xref ref="fig-implication-tt"/>).  What shape illustrates line 2?  That would need to be a shape that was a square and was not a rectangle.... Of course we can't find one, precisely because the statement is true!
				</p>

<subsection xml:id="subsec-related-statements">
	<title>Related Statements</title>
	
		<p>
			An implication is a way of expressing a relationship between two statements.
			It is often interesting to ask whether there are other relationships between the statements.
			Here we introduce some common language to address this question.
		</p>

		<definition>
			<title>Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse</title>
			<idx><h>converse</h></idx>
			<idx><h>contrapositive</h></idx>
			<idx><h>inverse</h></idx>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Given an implication <m>P \imp Q</m>, we say,
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>The <term>converse</term> is the statement <m>Q \imp P</m>.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>The <term>contrapositive</term> is the statement <m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m>.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The <term>inverse</term> is the statement, <m>\neg P \imp \neg Q</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>


		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the implication, <q>If you clean your room, then you can go to the party.</q>  Give the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of this statement
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The converse is, <q>If you can go to the party, then you clean your room.</q>
				</p>
				<p>
					The contrapositive is, <q>If you can't go to the party, then you don't clean your room.</q>
				</p>
				<p>
					The inverse is, <q>If you don't clean your room, then you can't go to the party.</q>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Symbolically, both the converse and the contrapositive <em>switch</em> the order of the two parts of the statement (or alternatively, think about turning the arrow to point in the other direction).  The contrapositive and the inverse take the <em>negation</em> of both of the statements.  Notice that if you take the converse (switch the order) and then take the contrapositive <em>of</em> that converse (switch the order back and negate both parts) you get the inverse.  So the inverse is nothing more than the contrapositive of the converse.  Or the converse of the contrapositive, which is a fun fact to mention at parties.
		</p>

		<p>
			When considering statements with quantifiers, we ignore the outside quantifiers when forming the converse, contrapositive, and inverse.  
		</p>
			
		<assemblage xml:id="assemblage-converse-contrapositive-inverse-quantifiers">
			<title>Quantifiers and the Converse, Contrapositive, and Inverse</title>
			<p>
				A quantified implication <m>\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))</m> has:
				<dl width="wide">
					<li>
						<title>Converse</title>
						<p>
							<m>\forall x (Q(x) \imp P(x))</m>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<title>Contrapositive</title>
						<p>
							<m>\forall x (\neg Q(x) \imp \neg P(x))</m>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<title>Inverse</title>
						<p>
							<m>\forall x (\neg P(x) \imp \neg Q(x))</m>
						</p>
					</li>
				</dl>
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		
		<note>
			<p>
				It is unlikely that we would encounter a statement of the form <m>\exists x (P(x) \imp Q(x))</m>, since this would be automatically true if there was any <m>x</m> that made <m>P(x)</m> false.  But if we did, the same rules would apply to the converse, contrapositive, and inverse as above: Just ignore the quantifier when swapping and/or negating the parts of the implication.
			</p>
		</note>


		<p>
			For example, <q>For all shapes, if the shape is a square, then it is a rectangle</q> (i.e., all squares are rectangles) has the converse, <q>For all shapes, if the shape is a rectangle, then it is a square</q> (so all rectangles are squares).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Well, that's not true!  There exist shapes that are rectangles and are NOT squares.  Indeed, this is an example of a statement that is true with a false converse.  There are lots of examples of this throughout mathematics.  There are also examples of true implications that have true converses.  You just can't know from the logic.<fn>
				It turns out the Pythagorean Theorem is one such statement.  It is also true that <em>if</em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>,
				<em>then</em> there is a right triangle with legs of lengths <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> and hypotenuse of length <m>c</m>.
				So we could have also written the theorem as a biconditional:
				<q><m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the lengths of the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse of length <m>c</m> <em>if and only if</em>
				<m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
				</fn>
		</p>

		<p>
			The contrapositive of <q>For all shapes, if it is a square, then it is a rectangle</q> is <q>For all shapes, if the shape is not a rectangle, then it is not a square.</q>  This is true.  In fact, <alert>the contrapositive of a true statement is always true</alert>!  
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the contrapositive of an implication
			always has the same truth value as its original implication, it can often be helpful to analyze the contrapositive to decide whether an implication is true.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					True or false: If you draw any nine playing cards from a regular deck,
					then you will have at least three cards all of the same suit.
					Is the converse true?
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>

					True.
					The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many combinations of nine cards.
					But consider the contrapositive: if you <em>don't</em>
					have at least three cards all of the same suit,
					then you don't have nine cards.
					It is easy to see why this is true.
					If you don't have at least three cards in a suit, you can have at most two cards of each of the four suits,
					for a total of at most eight cards.
				</p>

				<p>
					The converse: If you have at least three cards of the same suit,
					then you have nine cards.
					This is false.
					You could have three spades and nothing else.
					Note that to demonstrate that the converse
					(an implication)
					is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true
					(you do have three cards of the same suit),
					but where the conclusion is false
					(you do not have nine cards).  In other words, we find some example that puts us in row 2 of the implication's truth table.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Understanding converses and contrapositives can help understand implications and their truth values:
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose I tell Sue that if she gets a 93% on her final,
					then she will get an A in the class.
					Assuming that what I said is true,
					what can you conclude in the following cases:
				</p>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Sue gets a 93% on her final.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Sue gets an A in the class.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Sue does not get a 93% on her final.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								Sue does not get an A in the class.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Note first that whenever
					<m>P \imp Q</m> and
					<m>P</m> are both true statements,
					<m>Q</m> must be true as well.
					For this problem, take
					<m>P</m> to mean
					<q>Sue gets a 93%
					on her final</q> and
					<m>Q</m> to mean
					<q>Sue will get an A in the class.</q>
				</p>

				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								We have <m>P \imp Q</m> and <m>P</m>, so <m>Q</m> follows.
								Sue gets an A.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								You cannot conclude anything.
								Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit, for example.
								Notice that we do not know that if Sue gets an <m>A</m>,
								then she gets a 93% on her final.
								That is the converse of the original implication,
								so it might or might not be true.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								The contrapositive of the converse of
								<m>P \imp Q</m> is <m>\neg P \imp \neg Q</m>,
								which states that if Sue does not get a 93% on the final,
								then she will not get an A in the class.
								But this does not follow from the original implication.
								Again, we can conclude nothing.
								Sue could have done extra credit.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								What would happen if Sue did not get an A but <em>did</em>
								get a 93% on the final?
								Then <m>P</m> would be true, and <m>Q</m> would be false.
								This makes the implication <m>P \imp Q</m> false!
								It must be that Sue did not get a 93% on the final.
								Notice we now have the implication
								<m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m> which is the contrapositive of <m>P \imp Q</m>.
								Since <m>P \imp Q</m> is assumed to be true,
								we know <m>\neg Q \imp \neg P</m> is true as well.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			As we said above,
			an implication is not logically equivalent to its converse,
			but it is possible that both the implication and its converse are true.
			In this case, when both
			<m>P \imp Q</m> and
			<m>Q \imp P</m> are true, we say that
			<m>P</m> and
			<m>Q</m> are equivalent and write <m>P \iff Q</m>.
			This is the biconditional we mentioned in <xref ref="sec_logic-statements"/>.
		</p>


		<p>
			You can think of <q>if and only if</q>
			statements as having two parts:
			an implication and its converse.
			We might say one is the <q>if</q> part,
			and the other is the <q>only if</q> part.
			We also sometimes say that <q>if and only if</q>
			statements have two directions:
			a forward direction <m>(P \imp Q)</m> and a backward direction
			(<m>P \leftarrow Q</m>,
			which is really just sloppy notation for <m>Q \imp P</m>).
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's think a little about which part is which.
			Is <m>P \imp Q</m> the <q>if</q>
			part or the <q>only if</q> part?
			Consider an example.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Suppose it is true that I sing if and only if I'm in the shower.
					We know this means both that if I sing, then I'm in the shower,
					and also the converse, that if I'm in the shower, then I sing.
					Let <m>P</m> be the statement,
					<q>I sing,</q> and <m>Q</m> be,
					<q>I'm in the shower.</q> So
					<m>P \imp Q</m> is the statement <q>if I sing,
					then I'm in the shower.</q> Which part of the if and only if statement is this?
				</p>

				<p>
					What we are really asking for is the meaning of <q>I sing
					<em>if</em> I'm in the shower</q>
					and <q>I sing <em>only if</em>
					I'm in the shower.</q> When is the first one
					(the <q>if</q> part)
					<em>false</em>?
					When I am in the shower but not singing.
					That is the same condition for being false as the statement,
					<q>If I'm in the shower,
					then I sing.</q> So the <q>if</q> part is <m>Q \imp P</m>.
					On the other hand, to say,
					<q>I sing only if I'm in the shower</q>
					is equivalent to saying <q>If I sing,
					then I'm in the shower,</q> so the
					<q>only if</q> part is <m>P \imp Q</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</example>

		<p>
			It is not especially important to know which part is the
			<q>if</q> or <q>only if</q> part,
			but this does illustrate something very, very important:
			<em>There are many ways to state an implication!</em>
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Rephrase the implication,
					<q>If I dream, then I am asleep</q>
					in as many ways as possible.
					Then do the same for the converse.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					The following are all equivalent to the original implication:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								I am asleep if I dream.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								I dream only if I am asleep.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								In order to dream, I must be asleep.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								To dream, it is necessary that I am asleep.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								To be asleep, it is sufficient to dream.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								I am not dreaming unless I am asleep.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					The following are equivalent to the converse (if I am asleep,
					then I dream):
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								I dream if I am asleep.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								I am asleep only if I dream.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								It is necessary that I dream in order to be asleep.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								It is sufficient that I be asleep in order to dream.
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>
								If I don't dream, then I'm not asleep.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Hopefully you agree with the above example.
			We include the
			<q>necessary and sufficient</q>
			versions because those are common when discussing mathematics.
			Let's agree once and for all what they mean.

			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			To be honest, I have trouble with these if I'm not very careful.
			I find it helps to keep a standard example for reference.
		</p>

		<example>
	<statement>
		<p>
			In a regular deck of cards, the red suits are hearts and diamonds.  The black suits are clubs and spades.  Thus it is true that, after picking a card, if my card is a spade, then my card is black.  
		</p>

		<p>
			Restate this fact using necessary and sufficient phrasing.
		</p>
	</statement>
	<solution>
		<p>
			For my card to be a spade, it is necessary that it is black.  However, it is not sufficient for it to be black to say that I am holding a spade (since I could have a club).
		</p>

		<p>
			I can also say that to have a black card, it is sufficient to have a spade.  It is not necessary that I have a spade.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is helpful to think about the amount of evidence you need.  Is knowing that the card is a spade enough evidence to conclude that it is a black card?  Yes, that is sufficient!  Being a spade is a sufficient condition for the card to be black.
		</p>
	</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Thinking about the necessity and sufficiency of conditions can also help when writing proofs and justifying conclusions.
			If you want to establish some mathematical fact,
			it is helpful to think what other facts would
			<em>be enough</em>
			(be sufficient)
			to prove your fact.
			If you have an assumption,
			think about what must also be necessary if that hypothesis is true.

		<title>Projects</title>
		<project>
			<statement>
				<p>
					This is a first test project.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</project>


		<project>
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q>  You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.
				</p>
			</introduction>


			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which.
						Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						The converse: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is solitary, then <m>n</m> is prime.
						The contrapositive: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is not solitary, then <m>n</m> is not prime.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>


			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Write the negation of the original statement.
						What would you need to show to prove that the statement is false?
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary.
						So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>


			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Even though you don't know whether 10 is solitary (in fact, nobody knows this), is the statement <q>if 10 is prime, then 10 is solitary</q> true or false?  Explain.
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						This statement is true.
						The hypothesis of the statement is false (10 is not prime), so the implication is automatically true.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>


			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It turns out that 8 is solitary.
						Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive?  Explain.
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).
						All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.
						However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</task>


			<task>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em> <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em> <m>S</m> of solitary numbers.
						Explain.
					</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
					<p>
						We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.
						Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
