        <m>3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85\ldots</m>. Then give a recursive definition for the sequence.

        171 and 341. <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 2a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 5</m>.

              If you look at the sequence of differences between terms,

    <statement>
      <p>
        Show that <m>4^n</m> is a solution to the recurrence relation <m>a_n = 3a_{n-1} + 4a_{n-2}</m>.

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We claim <m>a_n = 4^n</m> works.

        We have characteristic polynomial <m>x^2 - 2x + 1</m>,
        which has <m>x = 1</m> as the only repeated root.

        the general solution is <m>a_n = a + bn</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> depend on the initial conditions.

        Here is a surprising use of sequences to answer a counting question:  How many license plates consist of 6 symbols, using only the three numerals 1, 2, and 3 and the four letters a, b, c, and d, so that no numeral appears after any letter?  For example, <q>31ddac</q>, <q>123321</q>, and <q>ababab</q> are each acceptable license plates, but <q>13ba2c</q> is not.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              First answer this question by considering different cases: how many of the license plates contain no numerals?  How many contain one numeral, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Now use the techniques of this section to show why the answer is <m>4^7 - 3^7</m>.
