        On the way to the market,
        you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans.
        These beans have the property that every night at midnight,
        each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection.
        You decide to take advantage of this and each morning (around 8am) you eat 5 beans.

              Explain why it is true that <em>if</em>
              at noon on day <m>n</m> you have a number of beans ending in a 5, then at noon on day <m>n+1</m> you will still have a number of beans ending in a 5.

              Illustrate what is going on by carefully explaining how the two facts above prove that you will have a number of beans ending in a 5 on
              <em>day 4</em> specifically.
              In other words, explain why induction works in this context.

              If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it,
              we will get a number of beans ending in a 0
              (since <m>5\cdot 2 = 10</m> ).
              Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5.
              Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.

              If you don't <em>start</em> with a number of beans ending in a 5
              (on day 1),
              the above reasoning is still correct but not helpful.
              For example,
              if you start with a number ending in a 3, the next day you will have a number ending in a 1.

              Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case.
              If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)),
              then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)).
              Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3.
              By part (a) again,
              this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4

            <p permid="LPT">
              The proof by induction would say that on <em>every</em>
              day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case,
              then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired <m>n</m>.

          We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First we establish the base case,
          <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>.
          Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>,
          we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true.
          Now for the inductive case.
          Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>.
          That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>.

          To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:

          We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
          First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>.
          Since <m>7^0 - 1 = 0</m>,

          Now for the inductive case.

          First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>.
          We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true,

      <p permid="qwk">
        Given a square,
        you can cut the square into smaller squares by cutting along lines parallel to the sides of the original square
        (these lines do not need to travel the entire side length of the original square).
        For example, by cutting along the lines below,
        you will divide a square into 6 smaller squares:

      <p permid="dxY">
        You will need three base cases.  This is a very good hint actually, as it suggests that to prove <m>P(n)</m> is true, you would want to use the fact that <m>P(n-3)</m> is true.  So somehow you need to increase the number of squares by 3.
