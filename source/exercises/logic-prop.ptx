        Simplifying negations will be especially useful in the next section when we try to prove a
        statement by considering what would happen if it were false. For each statement below, write

        It might help to translate the statements into symbols and then use the formulaic rules to
        simplify negations (i.e., rules for quantifiers and De Morgan's laws). After simplifying,
        you should get <m>\forall x(\neg E(x) \wedge \neg O(x))</m>, for the first one, for example.
        Then translate this back into English. </p>
