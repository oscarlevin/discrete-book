            A graph with five vertices; two in a top row, and three in a bottom row.  The top-left vertex is adjacent to the top-right vertex, the bottom-right vertex, and the bottom-middle vertex.  The top-right vertex is also adjacent to the bottom-middle vertex and the bottom-left vertex.  The bottom-middle vertex is adjacent to each of the other bottom vertices.

            A graph with five vertices: three are arranged in a top row, and the remaining two are directly below the left and right vertices on the top row.  The vertex in the center of the row is adjacent to each of the other vertices.  The two vertices on the left are adjacent, as are the two vertices on the right.  Finally the top-left and top-right are adjacent by a curved edge.

        The first and the third graphs are the same
        (try dragging vertices around to make the pictures match up),
        but the middle graph is different
        (which you can see, for example,
        by noting that the middle graph has only one vertex of degree 2, while the others have two such vertices).

        Consider the graph <m>G = (V, E)</m> with

              Yes, the graphs are isomorphic,
              which you can see by drawing them.
              One isomorphism is:
              <me>
                f = \begin{pmatrix}
                a \amp b \amp c \amp d \amp e \amp f \amp g \\
                u \amp z \amp v \amp x \amp w \amp y \amp t
                \end{pmatrix}
              </me>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This is easy to do if you draw the picture.
              Here is such a graph:
            </p>

                A tree with a bottom vertex adjacent to each of three vertices in a row above it.  Each of these is adjacent to another vertex directly above them.

            </image>


            <p>
              Any labeling of this graph will be not isomorphic to <m>G</m>.
              For example,
              we could take <m>V'' = \{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}</m> and <m>E'' = \{ab,
              ac, ad, be, cf, dg\} </m>.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              The degree sequence for <m>G</m> is <m>(3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              In general this should be possible:
              The degree sequence does not determine the graph's isomorphism class.
              However, in this case, I was almost certain this was not possible.
              That is, until I stumbled up this:

              color <m>a, d, e, g</m> red and <m>b, c, f</m> blue),

              It is clear from the drawing that there is no Euler trail,
              let alone an Euler circuit.
              Also, since there are more than 2 vertices of odd degree,
              we know for sure there is no Euler trail.

              Such a graph would have <m>\frac{5n}{2}</m> edges.
              If the graph is planar, then
              <m>n - \frac{5n}{2} + f = 2</m> so there would be <m>\frac{4+3n}{2}</m> faces.
              Also, we must have <m>3f \le 2e</m>,
              since the graph is simple.

        Your friend has challenged you to create a convex polyhedron containing 9 triangles and 6 pentagons.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is it possible to build such a polyhedron using
              <em>only</em> these shapes?
              Explain.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              You decide to also include one heptagon
              (seven-sided polygon).
              How many vertices does your new convex polyhedron contain?
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Assuming you are successful in building your new 16-faced polyhedron,
              could every vertex be the joining of the same number of faces?
              Could each vertex join either 3 or 4 faces?
              If so, how many of each type of vertex would there be?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              No.
              The 9 triangles each contribute 3 edges,
              and the 6 pentagons contribute 5 edges.
              This gives a total of 57,
              which is exactly twice the number of edges,
              since each edge borders exactly 2 faces.
              But 57 is odd, so this is impossible.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Now adding up all the edges of all the 16 polygons gives a total of 64,
              meaning there would be 32 edges in the polyhedron.
              We can then use Euler's formula
              <m>v - e + f = 2</m> to deduce that there must be 18 vertices.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If you add up all the vertices from each polygon separately,
              we get a total of 64.
              This is not divisible by 3, so it cannot be that each vertex belongs to exactly 3 faces.
              Could they all belong to 4 faces?
              That would mean there were <m>64/4 = 16</m> vertices,
              but we know from Euler's formula that there must be 18 vertices.
              We can write <m>64 = 3x + 4y</m> and solve for <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>
              (as integers).
              We get that there must be 10 vertices with degree 4 and 8 with degree 3. (Note that the number of faces joined at a vertex is equal to its degree in graph theoretic terms.)

        No.

    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The chromatic number of <m>K_{3,4}</m> is 2, since the graph is bipartite.
        You cannot say whether the graph is planar based on this coloring
        (the converse of the Four Color Theorem is not true).
        In fact, the graph is <em>not</em> planar,
        since it contains <m>K_{3,3}</m> as a subgraph.

      <p>
        We have that <m>K_{3,4}</m> has 7 vertices and 12 edges

        Then by Euler's formula we have that
        <m>7 - 12 + f = 2</m>, so if the graph were planar,
        it would have <m>f = 7</m> faces.
        However, since the girth of the graph is 4
        (there are no cycles of length 3),
        we get that <m>4f \le 2e</m>.

        For all these questions, we are really coloring the vertices of a graph.
        You get the graph by first drawing a planar representation of the polyhedron and then taking its planar dual:
        Put a vertex in the center of each face
        (including the outside),
        and connect two vertices if their faces share an edge.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the planar dual of a dodecahedron contains a 5-wheel,
              its chromatic number is at least 4.
              Alternatively,
              suppose you could color the faces using 3 colors without any two adjacent faces colored the same.
              Take any face, and color it blue.
              The 5 pentagons bordering this blue pentagon cannot be colored blue.
              Color the first one red.
              Its two neighbors
              (adjacent to the blue pentagon)
              get colored green.
              The remaining 2 cannot be blue or green,
              but also cannot both be red since they are adjacent to each other.
              Thus a 4th color is needed.

            <p>
              The planar dual of the dodecahedron is itself a planar graph.
              Thus by the 4-color theorem,
              it can be colored using only 4 colors without two adjacent vertices
              (corresponding to the faces of the polyhedron)
              being colored identically.

            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If two graphs <m>G_1</m> and <m>G_2</m> have the same number of vertices and edges and have the same chromatic number,
              then they are isomorphic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              If two graphs are isomorphic,
              then they have the same chromatic number.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              False.
              To prove this,
              we can give an example of a pair of graphs with the same chromatic number that are not isomorphic.
              For example,
              <m>K_{3,3}</m> and <m>K_{3,4}</m> both have chromatic number 2 but are not isomorphic.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              False.
              The previous example does not work,
              but you can easily draw two trees that have the same number of vertices and edges but are not isomorphic.
              Since all trees have chromatic number 2, this is a counterexample.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              True.
              If there is an isomorphism from <m>G_1</m> to <m>G_2</m>,
              then we have a bijection that tells us how to match up vertices between the graph.
              Any proper vertex coloring of <m>G_1</m> will tell us how to properly color <m>G_2</m>,
              simply by coloring <m>f(v_i)</m> the same color as <m>v_i</m>,
              for each vertex <m>v_i \in V</m>.
              That is, color the vertices in <m>G_2</m> exactly how you color the corresponding vertices in <m>G_1</m>.
              Similarly, any proper vertex coloring of <m>G_2</m> corresponds to a proper vertex coloring of <m>G_1</m>.
              Thus the smallest number of colors needed to properly color <m>G_1</m> cannot be smaller than the smallest number of colors needed to properly color <m>G_2</m>,
              and vice-versa, so the chromatic numbers must be equal.

    <statement>

        Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges.  Use mathematical induction to prove that if <m>G</m> contains exactly one cycle (among other edges and vertices), then <m>v = e</m>.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note: This is asking you to prove a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, so do not use that formula in your proof.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You might want to give the proof in two parts.  First prove by induction that the cycle <m>C_n</m> has <m>v=e</m>.  Then consider what happens if the graph is more than just the cycle.

        Remember that a <term>tree</term>

            <p>
              Conjecture a relationship between a tree graph's vertices and edges. (For instance,
              can you have a tree with 5 vertices and 7 edges?)
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Explain why every tree with at least 3 vertices has a leaf (i.e., a vertex of degree 1).
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Prove your conjecture from part (a) by induction on the number of vertices.
              Hint: For the inductive step,
              you will assume that your conjecture is true for all trees with <m>k</m> vertices,
              and show it is also true for an arbitrary tree with <m>k+1</m> vertices.
              Consider what happens when you cut off a leaf and then let it regrow.
