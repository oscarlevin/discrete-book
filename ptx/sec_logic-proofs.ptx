      Anyone who doesn't believe there is creativity in mathematics clearly has not tried to write proofs.
      Finding a way to convince the world that a particular statement is necessarily true is a mighty undertaking and can often be quite challenging.
      There is not a guaranteed path to success in the search for proofs.
      For example, in the summer of 1742,
      a German mathematician by the name of Christian Goldbach wondered whether every even integer greater than 2 could be written as the sum of two primes.
      Centuries later, we still don't have a proof of this apparent fact
      (computers have checked that <q>Goldbach's Conjecture</q>
      holds for all numbers less than <m>4\times 10^{18}</m>,
      which leaves only infinitely many more numbers to check).
    </p>

    <p permid="eGV">
      Writing proofs is a bit of an art.
      Like any art, to be truly great at it,
      you need some sort of inspiration,
      as well as some foundational technique.
      Just as musicians can learn proper fingering,
      and painters can learn the proper way to hold a brush,
      we can look at the proper way to construct arguments.
      A good place to start might be to study a classic.
    </p>

    <theorem permid="LFc">
      <statement>
        <p permid="wKz">
          There are infinitely many primes.

      </statement>
    </theorem>

    <proof permid="qGS">
      <p permid="saG">
        Suppose this were not the case.
        That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes.
        Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
        Consider the number
        <me permid="JIL">
          N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1
        </me>.

      <p permid="YhP">
        Now <m>N</m> is certainly larger than <m>p</m>.
        Also, <m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m>,
        since every number less than or equal to <m>p</m> divides <m>p!</m>.
        Thus the prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers
        (possibly just <m>N</m> itself)
        all greater than <m>p</m>.
        So <m>p</m> is not the largest prime, a contradiction.
        Therefore there are infinitely many primes.

      This proof is an example of a <em>proof by contradiction</em>,
      one of the standard styles of mathematical proof.
      First and foremost, the proof is an argument.
      It contains sequence of statements,
      the last being the <em>conclusion</em>
      which follows from the previous statements.
      The argument is valid so the conclusion must be true if the premises are true.
      Let's go through the proof line by line.

      We should say a bit more about the last line.
      Up through line 8, we have a valid argument with the premise
      <q>there are only finitely many primes</q>

      This is a valid argument as each line follows from previous lines.
      So if the premises are true, then the conclusion <em>must</em> be true.
      However, the conclusion is NOT true.
      The only way out: the premise must be false.

    <p permid="DjF">
      The sort of line-by-line analysis we did above is a great way to really understand what is going on.
      Whenever you come across a proof in a textbook,
      you really should make sure you understand what each line is saying and why it is true.
      Additionally,
      it is equally important to understand the overall structure of the proof.
      This is where using tools from logic is helpful.
      Luckily there are a relatively small number of standard proof styles that keep showing up again and again.
      Being familiar with these can help understand proof,
      as well as give ideas of how to write your own.

    <title>Direct Proof</title>
      <idx><h>direct proof</h></idx>

    <p permid="jqO">
      The simplest
      (from a logic perspective)
      style of proof is a <term>direct proof</term>.
      Often all that is required to prove something is a systematic explanation of what everything means.
      Direct proofs are especially useful when proving implications.
      The general format to prove <m>P \imp Q</m> is this:

        <ellipsis/>, explain.
        Therefore <m>Q</m>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="PxX">
      Often we want to prove universal statements,
      perhaps of the form <m>\forall x (P(x) \imp Q(x))</m>.
      Again, we will want to assume <m>P(x)</m> is true and deduce <m>Q(x)</m>.
      But what about the <m>x</m>?
      We want this to work for <em>all</em> <m>x</m>.
      We accomplish this by fixing <m>x</m> to be an arbitrary element
      (of the sort we are interested in).

      So far we have gotten only primes.
      You might be tempted to conjecture,
      <q>For all positive integers <m>n</m>,
      the number <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is prime.</q>
      If you wanted to prove this,
      you would need to use a direct proof,
      a proof by contrapositive, or another style of proof,
      but certainly it is not enough to give even 7 examples.
      In fact, we can prove this conjecture is
      <em>false</em> by proving its negation:
      <q>There is a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 - n + 41</m> is not prime.</q>
      Since this is an existential statement,
      it suffices to show that there does indeed exist such a number.

    <p permid="Rnk">
      In fact, we can quickly see that <m>n = 41</m> will give <m>41^2</m> which is certainly not prime.

      Since so many statements in mathematics are universal,

            This give
            <md permid="fqP">
              <mrow>n^3 - n \amp = 8k^3 - 2k</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^2 - k)</mrow>
            </md>,
            and since <m>4k^2 - k</m> is an integer,
            this says that <m>n^3-n</m> is even.

          <p permid="fMo">
            <u>Case 2</u>: <m>n</m> is odd.
            Then <m>n = 2k+1</m> for some integer <m>k</m>.
            This gives
            <md permid="LxY">
              <mrow>n^3 - n \amp = (2k+1)^3 - (2k+1)</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 8k^3 + 6k^2 + 6k + 1 - 2k - 1</mrow>
              <mrow>\amp = 2(4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k)</mrow>
            </md>,
            and since <m>4k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k</m> is an integer,
            we see that <m>n^3 - n</m> is even again.
          </p>

          <p permid="LTx">
            Since <m>n^3 - n</m> is even in both exhaustive cases,
            we see that <m>n^3 - n</m> is indeed always even.
