    <p permid="Fte">
      A <term>sequence</term>
          <idx><h>sequence</h></idx>
      is simply an ordered list of numbers.
      For example, here is a sequence: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, <ellipsis/>.
      This is different from the set <m>\N</m> because,
      while the sequence is a complete list of every element in the set of natural numbers,
      in the sequence we very much care what order the numbers come in.
      For this reason,
      when we use variables to represent terms in a sequence they will look like this:
      <me permid="npA">
        a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots
      </me>.
      To refer to the <em>entire</em> sequence at once,
      we will write <m>(a_n)_{n\in\N}</m> or <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m>,
      or sometimes if we are being sloppy, just <m>(a_n)</m>
      (in which case we assume we start the sequence with <m>a_0</m>).

      <notation>
        <usage>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</usage>
        <description>the sequence <m>a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots</m></description>
      </notation>

    </p>

    <p permid="lAn">
      We might replace the <m>a</m> with another letter,
      and sometimes we omit <m>a_0</m>, starting with <m>a_1</m>,
      in which case we would use
      <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> to refer to the sequence as a whole.
      The numbers in the subscripts are called <term>indices</term>
      (the plural of <term>index</term>).
    </p>

    <p permid="RHw">
      While we often just think of sequences as an ordered list of numbers,
      they really are a type of function.
      Specifically, the sequence
      <m>(a_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> is a function with domain <m>\N</m> where <m>a_n</m> is the image of the natural number <m>n</m>.
      Later we will manipulate sequences in much the same way you have manipulated functions in algebra or calculus.
      We can shift a sequence up or down,
      add two sequences, or ask for the rate of change of a sequence.
      These are done exactly as you would for functions.
    </p>

    <p permid="xOF">
      That said, while keeping the rigorous mathematical definition in mind is helpful,
      we often describe sequences by writing out the first few terms.

      It is easier to understand what is going on here with an example:
    </p>

    <example permid="KTV">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ouT">
          Here are a few closed formulas for sequences:

          Note in each case, if you are given <m>n</m>,
          you can calculate <m>a_n</m> directly:
          just plug in <m>n</m>.
          For example, to find <m>a_3</m> in the second sequence,
          just compute <m>a_3 = \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = 6</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="AJl">
          Here are a few recursive definitions for sequences:

            <li permid="xAk"><m>a_n = 2a_{n-1}</m> with <m>a_0 = 1</m>.</li>

          In the second sequence, to find <m>a_3</m> you would take <m>2a_2</m>,
          but to find <m>a_2 = 2a_1</m> we would need to know <m>a_1 = 2a_0</m>.
          We do know this,
          so we could trace back through these equations to find <m>a_1 = 54</m>,

    <p permid="iFH">
      You might wonder why we would bother with recursive definitions for sequences.
      After all, it is harder to find <m>a_n</m> with a recursive definition than with a closed formula.
      This is true,
      but it is also harder to find a closed formula for a sequence than it is to find a recursive definition.
      So to find a useful closed formula,
      we might first find the recursive definition,
      then use that to find the closed formula.
    </p>

    <p permid="OMQ">
      This is not to say that recursive definitions aren't useful in finding <m>a_n</m>.
      You can always calculate <m>a_n</m> given a recursive definition,
      it might just take a while.

    <example permid="rbe">
      <statement>
        <p permid="MXD">
          Find <m>a_6</m> in the sequence defined by
          <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> with <m>a_0 = 3</m> and <m>a_1 = 4</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="bSg">
        <p permid="XwI">
          We know that <m>a_6 = 2a_5 - a_4</m>.
          So to find <m>a_6</m> we need to find <m>a_5</m> and <m>a_4</m>.
          Well
          <me permid="TwJ">
            a_5 = 2a_4 - a_3 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_4 = 2a_3 - a_2
          </me>,
          so if we can only find <m>a_3</m> and <m>a_2</m> we would be set.
          Of course
          <me permid="zDS">
            a_3 = 2a_2 - a_1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad a_2 = 2a_1 - a_0

          so we only need to find <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m>.
          But we are given these.
          Thus

        <p permid="DDR">
          Note that now we can guess a closed formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence:
          <m>a_n = n+3</m>.
          To be sure this will always work,
          we could plug in this formula into the recurrence relation:
          <md permid="LSk">
            <mrow>2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \amp = 2((n-1) + 3) - ((n-2) + 3)</mrow>

            <mrow>\amp = n + 3</mrow>

          </md>.
        </p>

        <p permid="jLa">
          That is not quite enough though,
          since there can be multiple closed formulas that satisfy the same recurrence relation;
          we must also check that our closed formula agrees on the initial terms of the sequence.
          Since <m>a_0 = 0 + 3 = 3</m> and
          <m>a_1 = 1+3 = 4</m> are the correct initial conditions,
          we can now conclude we have the correct closed formula.

    <p permid="uTZ">
      Finding closed formulas,
      or even recursive definitions,

      There is no one method for doing this.
      Just like in evaluating integrals or solving differential equations,
      it is useful to have a bag of tricks you can apply,
      but sometimes there is no easy answer.

    <p permid="bbi">
      One useful method is to relate a given sequence to another sequence for which we already know the closed formula.  To do this, we need a few <q>known sequences</q> to compare mystery sequences to.  Here are a few that are good to know.  We will verify the formulas for these in the coming sections.

                We are off because the indices are shifted.
                What we really want is <m>c_n = a_{n+1}+1</m> giving <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.

                What happens if we factor out a 2?
                We get <m>(T_n)</m>!
                More precisely, we find that <m>d_n/2 = T_n</m>,

                These are all triangular numbers.
                However, we are starting with 3 as our initial term instead of as our third term.
                So if we could plug in 2 instead of 0 into the formula for <m>T_n</m>,
                we would be set.
                Therefore the closed formula is
                <m>e_n = \frac{(n+2)(n+3)}{2}</m> (where <m>n+3</m> came from <m>(n+2)+1</m>).
                Thinking about sequences as functions,
                we are doing a horizontal shift by 2:
                <m>e_n = T_{n+2}</m> which would cause the graph to shift 2 units to the left.

                Try adding 1 to each term and we get powers of 2.
                You might guess this because each term is a little more than twice the previous term
                (the powers of 2 are <em>exactly</em>
                twice the previous term).

                These numbers are also doubling each time,
                but are also all multiples of 3.
                Dividing each by 3 gives 1, 2, 4, 8, <ellipsis/>.
                Aha.
                We get the closed formula <m>g_n = 3\cdot 2^{n}</m>.

                To get from one term to the next,
                we almost double each term.
                So maybe we can relate this back to <m>2^n</m>.
                Yes, each term is 2 more than a power of 2.
                So we get <m>h_n = 2^{n+2} + 2</m>
                (the <m>n+2</m> is because the first term is 2 more than <m>2^2</m>,
                not <m>2^0</m>).
                Alternatively,
                we could have related this sequence to the second sequence in this example:
                starting with 3, 5, 9, 17,
                <ellipsis/> we see that this sequence is twice the terms from that sequence.
                That sequence had closed formula <m>c_n = 2^{n+1} + 1</m>.
                Our sequence here would be twice this,
                so <m>h_n = 2(2^n + 1)</m>, which is the same as we got before.

                Try dividing each term by 3.
                That gives the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41,\ldots</m>.
                Now add 1 to each term: <m>6, 12, 20, 30, 42, \ldots</m>,
                which is <m>(d_n)</m> in this example,
                except starting with 6 instead of 0.
                So let's start with the formula <m>d_n= n(n+1)</m>.
                To start with the 6, we shift: <m>(n+2)(n+3)</m>.
                But this is one too many, so subtract 1:
                <m>(n+2)(n+3) - 1</m>.
                That gives us our sequence, but divided by 3.
                So we want <m>j_n = 3((n+2)(n+3) - 1)</m>.

    <title>Partial sums</title>
    <p>
      Some sequences naturally arise as the sum of terms of another sequence. 
    </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Sam keeps track of how many push-ups she does each day of her <q>do lots of push-ups challenge.</q>  Let <m>(a_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> be the sequence that describes the number of push-ups done on the <m>n</m>th day of the challenge.  The sequence starts
          <me>
            3, 5, 6, 10, 9, 0, 12, \ldots
          </me>.
          Describe a sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \ge 1}</m> that describes the total number of push-ups done by Sam after the <m>n</m>th day.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We can find the terms of this sequence easily enough.  <me>
            3, 8, 14, 24, 33, 33, 45,\ldots
          </me>.
          Here <m>b_1</m> is just <m>a_1</m>, but then <me>b_2 = 3+5 = a_1 + a_2</me>, <me>b_3 = 3+5+6 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3</me>,
          and so on.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There are a few ways we might describe <m>b_n</m> in general.  We could do so recursively as,
          <me>
            b_n = b_{n-1} + a_n
          </me>,
          since the total number of push-ups done after <m>n</m> days will be the number done after <m>n-1</m> days, plus the number done on day <m>n</m>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          For something closer to a closed formula, we could write 
          <me>
            b_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \cdots + a_n
          </me>,
          or the same thing using <em>summation notation</em>: 
          <me>
            b_n = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i
          </me>.
          However, note that these are not really closed formulas since even if we had a formula for <m>a_n</m>, we would still have an increasing number of computations to do as <m>n</m> increases.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>
      Given any sequence <m>(a_n)_{n \in \N}</m>, we can always form a new sequence <m>(b_n)_{n \in \N}</m> by
      <me>
        b_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n
      </me>.
       Since the terms of <m>(b_n)</m> are the sums of the initial part of the sequence <m>(a_n)</m> ways call <m>(b_n)</m> the <term>sequence of partial sums of <m>(a_n)</m></term>.  Soon we will see that it is sometimes possible to find a closed formula for <m>(b_n)</m> from the closed formula for <m>(a_n)</m>.
