    </investigation>
    <p permid="GZN">
      A <term>permutation</term> is a (possible) rearrangement of objects.
      For example,
      there are 6 permutations of the letters <em>a, b, c</em>:
      <me permid="BkB">
        abc, ~~ acb, ~~ bac, ~~bca, ~~ cab, ~~ cba
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="ngW">
      We know that we have them all listed above
      <mdash/>there are 3 choices for which letter we put first,
      then 2 choices for which letter comes next,
      which leaves only 1 choice for the last letter.
      The multiplicative principle says we multiply <m>3\cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.
    </p>

    <example permid="fXW">
      <statement>
        <p permid="qbC">
          How many permutations are there of the letters
          <em>a, b, c, d, e, f</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="wWh">
        <p permid="Uty">
          We do NOT want to try to list all of these out.
          However, if we did,
          we would need to pick a letter to write down first.
          There are 6 choices for that letter.
          For each choice of first letter,
          there are 5 choices for the second letter
          (we cannot repeat the first letter;
          we are rearranging letters and only have one of each),
          and for each of those,
          there are 4 choices for the third, 3 choices for the fourth, 2 choices for the fifth and finally only 1 choice for the last letter.
          So there are <m>6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 720</m> permutations of the 6 letters.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="Tof">
      A piece of notation is helpful here:
      <m>n!</m>, read <q><m>n</m> factorial</q>,
          <idx><h>factorial</h></idx>
      is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to <m>n</m>
      (for reasons of convenience, we also define 0! to be 1).
      So the number of permutation of 6 letters,
      as seen in the previous example is <m>6! = 6\cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1</m>.
      This generalizes:
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="nCv">
      <title>Permutations of <m>n</m> elements</title>
      <p permid="zvo">
        There are <m>n! = n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdot \cdots \cdot 2\cdot 1</m> permutations of <m>n</m> (distinct) elements.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <example permid="Mff" xml:id="example-counting-functions-bijective">
      <title>Counting Bijective Functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p permid="WiL">
          How many functions <m>f:\{1,2,\ldots,8\} \to \{1,2,\ldots, 8\}</m> are <em>bijective</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="ddq">
        <p permid="AAH">
          Remember what it means for a function to be bijective:
          each element in the codomain must be the image of exactly one element of the domain.
          Using two-line notation, we could write one of these bijections as
          <me permid="hrK">
            f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \amp 7 \amp 8} {3 \amp 1 \amp 5 \amp 8 \amp 7 \amp 6 \amp 2 \amp 4}
          </me>
          What we are really doing is just rearranging the elements of the codomain,
          so we are creating a permutation of 8 elements.
          In fact, <q>permutation</q> is another term used to describe bijective functions from a finite set to itself.
        </p>

        <p permid="gHQ">
          If you believe this,
          then you see the answer must be <m>8! = 8 \cdot 7 \cdot\cdots\cdot 1 = 40320</m>.
          You can see this directly as well:
          for each element of the domain,
          we must pick a distinct element of the codomain to map to.
          There are 8 choices for where to send 1, then 7 choices for where to send 2, and so on.
          We multiply using the multiplicative principle.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="fCx">
      Sometimes we do not want to permute all of the letters/numbers/elements we are given.
    </p>

    <example permid="smo">
      <statement>
        <p permid="CpU">
          How many 4 letter <q>words</q>
          can you make from the letters <em>a</em>
          through <em>f</em>, with no repeated letters?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="Jkz">
        <p permid="MOZ">
          This is just like the problem of permuting 4 letters,
          only now we have more choices for each letter.
          For the first letter, there are 6 choices.
          For each of those, there are 5 choices for the second letter.
          Then there are 4 choices for the third letter,
          and 3 choices for the last letter.
          The total number of words is <m>6\cdot 5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 360</m>.
          This is not <m>6!</m> because we never multiplied by 2 and 1.
          We could start with <m>6!</m> and then cancel the 2 and 1, and thus write <m>\frac{6!}{2!}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="LJG">
      In general, we can ask how many permutations exist of <m>k</m> objects choosing those objects from a larger collection of <m>n</m> objects.
      (In the example above, <m>k = 4</m>, and <m>n = 6</m>.)
      We write this number <m>P(n,k)</m> and sometimes call it a
      <term><m>k</m>-permutation of <m>n</m> elements</term>.
      From the example above,
      we see that to compute <m>P(n,k)</m> we must apply the multiplicative principle to <m>k</m> numbers,
      starting with <m>n</m> and counting backwards.
      For example
      <me permid="NyT">
        P(10, 4) = 10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="rQP">
      Notice again that <m>P(10,4)</m> starts out looking like <m>10!</m>,
      but we stop after 7.
      We can formally account for this <q>stopping</q>
      by dividing away the part of the factorial we do not want:
      <me permid="tGc">
        P(10,4) = \frac{10\cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}{6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{10!}{6!}
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="XXY">
      Careful: The factorial in the denominator is not <m>4!</m> but rather <m>(10-4)!</m>.
    </p>

    <assemblage permid="TJE">
      <title><m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements</title>
      <p permid="Efh">
            <idx><h><em>k</em>-permutation</h></idx>
            <idx><h>permutation</h></idx>
        <m>P(n,k)</m> is the number of <term><m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements</term>,
        the number of ways to <em>arrange</em>
        <m>k</m> objects chosen from <m>n</m> distinct objects.
        <me permid="ZNl">
          P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="kmq">
      Note that when <m>n = k</m>, we have <m>P(n,n) = \frac{n!}{(n-n)!} = n!</m>
      (since we defined <m>0!</m> to be 1).
      This makes sense
      <mdash/>we already know <m>n!</m> gives the number of permutations of all <m>n</m> objects.

    <example permid="Ytx" xml:id="example-counting-functions-injective">
      <title>Counting injective functions</title>
      <statement>
        <p permid="ixd">
          How many functions <m>f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}</m> are <em>injective</em>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="prI">
        <p permid="sWi">
          Note that it doesn't make sense to ask for the number of
          <em>bijections</em> here, as there are none
          (because the codomain is larger than the domain,
          there are no surjections).
          But for a function to be injective,
          we just can't use an element of the codomain more than once.
        </p>

        <p permid="Zdr">
          We need to pick an element from the codomain to be the image of 1.
          There are 8 choices.
          Then we need to pick one of the remaining 7 elements to be the image of 2.
          Finally, one of the remaining 6 elements must be the image of 3.
          So the total number of functions is <m>8\cdot 7 \cdot 6 = P(8,3)</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="FkA">
          What this demonstrates in general is that the number of injections <m>f:A \to B</m>,
          where <m>\card{A} = k</m> and <m>\card{B} = n</m>, is <m>P(n,k)</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p permid="Qtz">
      Here is another way to find the number of <m>k</m>-permutations of <m>n</m> elements:
      first select which <m>k</m> elements will be in the permutation,
      then count how many ways there are to arrange them.
      Once you have selected the <m>k</m> objects,
      we know there are <m>k!</m> ways to arrange (permute) them.
      But how do you select <m>k</m> objects from the <m>n</m>?
      You have <m>n</m> objects, and you need to
      <em>choose</em> <m>k</m> of them.
      You can do that in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
      Then for each choice of those <m>k</m> elements,
      we can permute <em>them</em> in <m>k!</m> ways.
      Using the multiplicative principle,
      we get another formula for <m>P(n,k)</m>:
      <me permid="FUu">
        P(n,k) = {n \choose k}\cdot k!
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="wAI">
      Now since we have a closed formula for <m>P(n,k)</m> already,
      we can substitute that in:
      <me permid="mbD">
        \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = {n \choose k} \cdot k!
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="cHR">
      If we divide both sides by <m>k!</m> we get a closed formula for <m>{n \choose k}</m>.

          {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}
        </me>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="oWj">
      We say <m>P(n,k)</m> counts <em>permutations</em>,
      and <m>{n \choose k}</m> counts <em>combinations</em>.
          <idx><h>combination</h></idx>
      The formulas for each are very similar,
      there is just an extra <m>k!</m> in the denominator of <m>{n \choose k}</m>.
      That extra <m>k!</m> accounts for the fact that
      <m>{n \choose k}</m> does not distinguish between the different orders that the <m>k</m> objects can appear in.
      We are just selecting
      (or choosing)
      the <m>k</m> objects, not arranging them.
      Perhaps <q>combination</q> is a misleading label.
      We don't mean it like a combination lock
      (where the order would definitely matter).
      Perhaps a better metaphor is a combination of flavors
      <mdash/> you just need to decide which flavors to combine,
      not the order in which to combine them.
    </p>

    <p permid="Vds">
      To further illustrate the connection between combinations and permutations,
      we close with an example.
    </p>

    <example permid="EAG">

                You must simply choose 6 friends from a group of 14.
                This can be done in <m>{14 \choose 6}</m> ways.
                We can find this number either by using Pascal's triangle or the closed formula:
                <m>\frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!} = 3003</m>.
              </p>

                Here you must count all the ways you can permute 6 friends chosen from a group of 14.
                So the answer is <m>P(14, 6)</m>,
                which can be calculated as <m>\frac{14!}{8!} = 2192190</m>.
              </p>

              <p permid="omp">
                Notice that we can think of this counting problem as a question about counting functions:
                how many injective functions are there from your set of 6 chairs to your set of 14 friends
                (the functions are injective because you can't have a single chair go to two of your friends).

            </li>
          </ol>

        <p permid="RyS">
          How are these numbers related?
          Notice that <m>P(14,6)</m> is <em>much</em>
          larger than <m>{14 \choose 6}</m>.
          This makes sense. <m>{14 \choose 6}</m> picks 6 friends,
          but <m>P(14,6)</m> arranges the 6 friends as well as picks them.
          In fact, we can say exactly how much larger <m>P(14,6)</m> is.
          In both counting problems we choose 6 out of 14 friends.
          For the first one, we stop there, at 3003 ways.
          But for the second counting problem,
          each of those 3003 choices of 6 friends can be arranged in exactly <m>6!</m> ways.
          So now we have <m>3003\cdot 6!</m> choices and that is exactly <m>2192190</m>.
        </p>

        <p permid="xGb">
          Alternatively, look at the first problem another way.
          We want to select 6 out of 14 friends,
          but we do not care about the order they are selected in.
          To select 6 out of 14 friends, we might try this:
          <me permid="ypV">
            14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="dNk">
          This is a reasonable guess,
          since we have 14 choices for the first guest,
          then 13 for the second, and so on.
          But the guess is wrong (in fact,
          that product is exactly <m>2192190 = P(14,6)</m>).
          It distinguishes between the different orders in which we could invite the guests.
          To correct for this,
          we could divide by the number of different arrangements of the 6 guests
          (so that all of these would count as just one outcome).
          There are precisely <m>6!</m> ways to arrange 6 guests,
          so the correct answer to the first question is
          <me permid="exe">
            \frac{14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11\cdot 10 \cdot 9}{6!}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="JUt">
          Note that another way to write this is
          <me permid="KEn">
            \frac{14!}{8!\cdot 6!}
          </me>.
          which is what we had originally.
