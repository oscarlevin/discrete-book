                  The permutation is in part (b),

                  At first this seems backwards,
                  since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter.
                  Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter.
                  The better way to
                  distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes.
                  In part (c),
                  there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits,
                  while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives

                  There are <m>120 = 5!</m> anagrams.
                  We can pick any of the 5 distinct letters to put first,
                  then any of the remaining 4, and so on.
                  We could also have written this <m>P(5,5)</m>.

                  We need to place 5 a's, 2 b's, 2 r's, and one each of c and d.
                  So first select 5 of the eleven slots for the a's, which can be done in <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> ways.
                  Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.
                  Next pick 2 of the remaining 4 slots of r's, in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways,
                  and finally pick one of the two available spots for the c leaving the last for the d.
                  Thus all together the number of anagrams is:
                  <me>
                    {11\choose 5}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}2\cdot 1 = 83160
                  </me>
                  (Note, if you pick a different letter to start with,
                  you get a different looking answer,
                  but the final product should be the same.)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another approach: Think of all of the letters as different
                  (so there are 5 a's, but maybe written in 5 different fonts,
                  for example.)
                  In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.
                  Now to correct for the repeated letters,
                  group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.
                  Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams
                  (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).
                  We just need to count groups, so the total is
                  <me>
                    \frac{11!}{5!2! 2!} = 83160
                  </me>
                </p>

                  We already know there are 120 5-letter sub-anagrams.
                  To find the 4-letter sub-anagrams,
                  we need to pick one of 5 letters first, then one of remaining,
                  then one of 3 after that and one of the remaining 2.
                  Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well
                  (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).
                  There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams,
                  <m>5\cdot 4 = 20</m> 2-letter sub-anagrams,
                  and <m>5</m> 1-letter sub-anagrams.
                  All together, this brings the number of sub-anagrams to
                  <me>
                    120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 = 325
