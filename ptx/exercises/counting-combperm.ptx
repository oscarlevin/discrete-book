              This is just the multiplicative principle.
              There are 7 digits which we can select for each of the 5 positions,

              <m>7^5 = 16807</m>

              After doing so,
              there will only be one way to arrange them into a 5-digit number.
              Thus there are

              The permutation is in part (b),
              while the combination is in part (c).
              At first this seems backwards,
              since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter.
              Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter.
              The better way to
              distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes.
              In part (c),
              there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits,
              while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives
              <m>5!</m>
              different outcomes.

              Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.

              In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.
              Now to correct for the repeated letters,
              group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.
              Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams
              (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).
              We just need to count groups, so the total is

              Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well
              (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).
              There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams,
