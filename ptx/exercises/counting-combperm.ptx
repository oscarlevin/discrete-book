        A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings.

        <li> <p> How many 3-topping pizzas could they put on their menu?  Assume double toppings are not allowed. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> How many total pizzas are possible, with between zero and ten toppings (but not double toppings) allowed? </p> </li>

        A combination lock consists of a dial with 40 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number, then to the left until you get to second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different combinations are possible?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Despite its name, we are not looking for a combination here. The order in which the three numbers appears matters. There are <m>P(40,3) = 40\cdot 39 \cdot 38</m> different possibilities for the <q>combination</q>. This is assuming you cannot repeat any of the numbers (if you could, the answer would be <m>40^3</m>).

        Using the digits 2 through 8, find the number of different 5-digit numbers such that:
      <ol>
        <li> <p> Digits can be used more than once. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated, but can come in any order. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Which of the above counting questions is a combination and which is a permutation?  Explain why this makes sense. </p> </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    </statement>
    <!-- <solution>
      <ol>
        <li> <p> This is just the multiplicative principle.  There are 7 digits which we can select for each of the 5 positions, so we have <m>7^5 = 16807</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> Now we have 7 choices for the first number, 6 for the second, etc.  So there are <m>7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = P(7,5) = 2520</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> To build such a number we simply must select 5 different digits.  After doing so, there will only be one way to arrange them into a 5-digit number.  Thus there are <m>{7 \choose 5} = 21</m> such numbers. </p> </li>
        <li> <p> The permutation is in part (b), while the combination is in part (c).  At first this seems backwards, since usually we use combinations for when order does not matter.  Here it looks like in part (c) that order does matter.  The better way to distinguish between combinations and permutations is to ask whether we are counting different arrangements as different outcomes.  In part (c), there is only one arrangement of any set of 5 digits, while in part (b) each set of 5 digits gives <m>5!</m> different outcomes. </p> </li>

        How many triangles are there with vertices from the points shown below? Note, we are not allowing degenerate triangles - ones with all three vertices on the same line, but we do allow non-right triangles. Explain why your answer is correct.

    <hint>
        <p>You need exactly two points on either the <m>x</m>- or <m>y</m>-axis, but don't over-count the right triangles.</p>
    </hint>
    <!-- <solution>
      <p>
        There are 120 triangles. Here are two ways (there are others as well) to get this:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            First count the triangles with the base on the <m>x</m>-axis. There are <m>{7 \choose 2}</m> ways to pick the base. The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the <m>y</m>-axis (not the origin) so there are a total of <m>{7 \choose 2}4</m> of these triangles. The triangles with base on the <m>y</m> axis can be counted similarly: <m>{5 \choose 2}6</m>. However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the <m>x</m>-axis and also on the <m>y</m>-axis. There are <m>4 \cdot 6</m> right triangles. Thus the total number of triangles is:
            <me>
              {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            We must select 3 of the 11 dots. This can be done in <m>{11 \choose 3}</m> ways. However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the <m>x</m>-axis or on the <m>y</m>-axis. There are <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>x</m>-axis. There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>y</m>-axis. Therefore the total number of triangles is
            <me>
              {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120

        <m>{7\choose 2}{7\choose 2} = 441</m> quadrilaterals. We must pick two of the seven dots from the top row and two of the seven dots on the bottom row. However, it does not make a difference which of the two (on each row) we pick first because once these four dots are selected, there is exactly one quadrilateral that they determine.

        An <em>anagram</em> of a word is just a rearrangement of its letters. How many different anagrams of <q>uncopyrightable</q> are there? (This happens to be the longest common English word without any repeated letters.)
      </p>
    </statement>
    <!-- <solution>
      <p>
        Since there are 15 different letters, we have 15 choices for the first letter, 14 for the next, and so on. Thus there are <m>15!</m> anagrams.

        How many anagrams are there of the word <q>assesses</q> that start with the letter <q>a</q>?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        After the first letter (a), we must rearrange the remaining 7 letters. There are only two letters (s and e), so this is really just a bit-string question (think of s as 1 and e as 0). Thus there <m>{7 \choose 2} = 21</m> anagrams starting with <q>a</q>.

    <!-- <solution>
      <p>
        First, decide where to put the <q>a</q>s. There are 7 positions, and we must choose 3 of them to fill with an <q>a</q>. This can be done in <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways. The remaining 4 spots all get a different letter, so there are <m>4!</m> ways to finish off the anagram. This gives a total of <m>{7 \choose 3}\cdot 4!</m> anagrams. Strangely enough, this is 840, which is also equal to <m>P(7,4)</m>. To get the answer that way, start by picking one of the 7 <em>positions</em> to be filled by the <q>n</q>, one of the remaining 6 positions to be filled by the <q>g</q>, one of the remaining 5 positions to be filled by the <q>r</q>, one of the remaining 4 positions to be filled by the <q>m</q> and then put <q>a</q>s in the remaining 3 positions.

      An <em>anagram</em> of a word is a rearrangement of its letters (each of the letters must be used exactly once).  We do not need the anagram to form an English word.

        <li>
          <p>
            How many anagrams are there of the word <q>abracadabra</q>? Explain.  Note that you need to figure out how to deal with the repeated letters (starting with the first <q>a</q> and then the second <q>a</q> gives the same word as starting with the second <q>a</q> and then the first <q>a</q>.

          <p>
            A <em>sub-anagram</em> is just like an anagram except now you don't need to use all of the letters (but you could).  So one sub-anagram of <q>magic</q> is <q>mac.</q>  How many sub-anagrams are there of the word <q>magic</q>?  Explain.  Hint: you might want to break this into cases.

              There are <m>120 = 5!</m> anagrams.  We can pick any of the 5 distinct letters to put first, then any of the remaining 4, and so on.  We could also have written this <m>P(5,5)</m>.

          <li>
            <p>
              We need to place 5 a's, 2 b's, 2 r's, and one each of c and d.  So first select 5 of the eleven slots for the a's, which can be done in <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> ways.  Then select 2 of the remaining 6 slots for b's, done in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways.  Next pick 2 of the remaining 4 slots of r's, in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways, and finally pick one of the two available spots for the c leaving the last for the d.  Thus all together the number of anagrams is:
              <me>
                {11\choose 5}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}2\cdot 1 = 83160
              </me>
              (Note, if you pick a different letter to start with, you get a different looking answer, but the final product should be the same.)
            </p>
            <p>
              Another approach: Think of all of the letters as different (so there are 5 a's, but maybe written in 5 different fonts, for example.)  In this case, there would be <m>11!</m> anagrams.  Now to correct for the repeated letters, group all the anagrams that just have different arrangements of the a's, b's and r's into groups.  Each group would have <m>5!\cdot 2! \cdot 2!</m> different anagrams (since there are <m>5!</m> ways to arrange the a's, <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the b's and <m>2!</m> ways to arrange the r's).  We just need to count groups, so the total is
              <me>
                \frac{11!}{5!2! 2!} = 83160
              </me>

          <li>
            <p>
              We already know there are 120 5-letter sub-anagrams.  To find the 4-letter sub-anagrams, we need to pick one of 5 letters first, then one of remaining, then one of 3 after that and one of the remaining 2.  Thus there are <m>5\cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 120</m> of these as well (we could think of these as exactly the 120 full anagrams with the last letter missing).  There will be <m>5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 = 60</m> 3-letter sub-anagrams, <m>5\cdot 4 = 20</m> 2-letter sub-anagrams, and <m>5</m> 1-letter sub-anagrams.  All together, this brings the number of sub-anagrams to
              <me>
                120 + 120 + 60 + 20 + 5 = 325

            Explain why it makes sense to divide <m>12!</m> by <m>7!</m> when computing <m>P(12,5)</m> (in terms of the chips).

            <!-- <solution>
              <p>
                Say you made all <m>12!</m> stacks of 12 chips. For any particular arrangement of the bottom 5 chips, you will have <m>7!</m> stacks that have that bottom arrangement (one for each arrangement of the remaining 7 chips). But we just want to count the number of 5-chip stacks, so we count all of these as the same outcome (once the top 7 chips are removed, the bottom stacks look identical). Thus we really want to count how many groups there are. All <m>12!</m> stacks are grouped into groups of size <m>7!</m>, so there are <m>12!/7!</m> groups.

            Does your explanation work for numbers other than 12 and 5? Explain the formula <m>P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> using the variables <m>n</m> and <m>k</m>.

            <!-- <solution>
              <p>
                <m>P(n,k)</m> counts the number of stacks of size <m>k</m> where the chips come in <m>n</m> different colors (with at most one chip of each color in the stack). You could count this by first forming all stacks of <m>n</m> chips, and there are <m>n!</m> of these. But to get stacks of size <m>k</m>, we don't want the top <m>n-k</m> chips. When we remove <m>n-k</m> chips from the stacks, we sometimes get the same arrangement of the bottom chips. In fact, for each arrangement of the bottom <m>k</m> chips, there are <m>(n-k)!</m> different ways to arrange the top <m>n-k</m> chips, and all of these should count as just 1 outcome. Thus we divide <m>n!</m> by <m>(n-k)!</m> to find the number of <m>k</m>-chip stacks.

        In an attempt to clean up your room, you have purchased a new floating shelf to put some of your 17 books you have stacked in a corner.  These books are all by different authors.  The new book shelf is large enough to hold 10 of the books.  Warning: before answering the next two questions, ask yourself which answer should be larger.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              How many ways can you select and arrange 10 of the 17 books on the shelf?  Notice that here we will allow the books to end up in any order.  Explain.

              We can write the answer as <m>P(17,10) = 17 \cdot 16 \cdot \cdots \cdot 8</m> , which is the same as <m>\frac{17!}{7!}</m> .  Or, if you think of picking the 10 books and then arranging those 10, you can write this as <m>\binom{17}{10}\cdot 10!</m> .  Note, that since any order is acceptable, we are distinguishing between different orders, so a permutation is appropriate here.

              Here we just need to select the books, and have no choice as how to arrange them.  So the answer is just <m>\binom{17}{10}</m>

              How many of the injective functions are <em>increasing</em>?  To be increasing means that if <m>a \gt b</m> then <m>f(a) \gt f(b)</m> , or in other words, the outputs get larger as the inputs get larger. Explain.
