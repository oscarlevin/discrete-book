                    There are <m>512</m> subsets. This is <m>2^9</m>, which makes sense because we are deciding yes or no on whether to include each element of <m>A</m> in the subset.

                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Of the nine elements in <m>A</m>, we must choose five of them to be in the subset. So <m>{9 \choose 5} = 126</m>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    For each of the 9 elements from <m>A</m>, we must decide yes or no on whether to include them in the subset. However, for the odd numbers, we only have one choice: no. So there are only 4 elements we have two choices for, so the answer is <m>2^4 = 16</m>. (Note, if you wish to exclude the empty set - it does not contain odd numbers, but no evens either - then you could subtract 1).

However, we count the strings that start with 101 and end with 11 twice - there are <m>16</m> such strings (<m>2^4</m>). So using PIE, we have <m>64 + 128 - 16 = 176</m>

We have over counted again - there are weight 5 strings which both start with 101 and end with 11, in fact <m>{4 \choose 1} = 4</m> of them. So all together we have <m>20 + 35 - 4 = 51</m> strings.

                    We can think of each row as a 6-bit string of weight 3 (since of the 6 coins, we require 3 to be pennies).  Thus there are <m>{6 \choose 3} = 20</m> rows possible.  Each row requires 6 coins, so if we want to make all the rows at the same time, we will need 120 coins (60 of each).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Now there are <m>2^6 = 64</m> rows possible, which is also <m>{6 \choose 0} + {6\choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + {6 \choose 3} + {6 \choose 4} + {6 \choose 5} + {6 \choose 6}</m>, if you break them up into rows containing 0, 1, 2, etc. pennies.  Thus we need <m>6 \cdot 64 = 384</m> coins (192 of each).

But doing this uses each entry on the <m>k</m>th row twice. Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double the total. Of course, row 0 has sum <m>1 = 2^0</m> (the base case). Now try to make this precise with a formal induction proof. You will use the fact that <m>{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m> for the inductive case.

            To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal's triangle. We are adding up the entries along a diagonal, starting with the 1 on the left-hand side of the 4th row. Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on this diagonal. The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries. Note that if this is true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries, we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum. But these two together give the entry below them, which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal. If you follow that, you can see what is going on. But it is not a great proof. A formal induction proof is needed:
          </p>

          <proof>
            <p>
              Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+n \choose n} = {5+n \choose n}</m>. For the base case, consider <m>n = 0</m>. This says <m>{4 \choose 0} = {5 \choose 0}</m>. Since these are both 1, the base case is true. Now for the inductive case, suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} = {5+k \choose k}</m>. If we add <m>{4+k+1 \choose k+1}</m> to both sides, we get

                {4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}= {5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}

              But <m>{5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1} = {5+k+1 \choose k+1}</m>. In other words, we have
              <me>
                {4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1} = {5+k+1 \choose k+1}
              </me>
              which is to say that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.
