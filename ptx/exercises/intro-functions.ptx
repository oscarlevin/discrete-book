        <statement>
          <p>
            Write out all functions <m>f: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b\}</m> (using two-line notation). How many are there? How many are injective? How many are surjective? How many are both?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 8 different functions. In two-line notation these are:

              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix}</me>
              <me> f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp a \end{pmatrix}
              </me>
              <me>
                \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp b \amp a \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ b \amp a\amp b \end{pmatrix} \quad f = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \\ a \amp b \amp b \end{pmatrix} </me>


            None of the functions are injective. Exactly 6 of the functions are surjective. No functions are both (since no functions here are injective).

        <solution>
          <p>
            There are 9 functions: you have a choice of three outputs for <m>f(1)</m>, and for each, you have three choices for the output <m>f(2)</m>. Of these functions, 6 are injective, 0 are surjective, and 0 are both:

              f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{a\amp a} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{b \amp b} \quad f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{c \amp c}

                  <m>f</m> is not injective. To prove this, we must simply find two different elements of the domain which map to the same element of the codomain. Since <m>f(\{1\}) = 1</m> and <m>f(\{2\}) = 1</m>, we see that <m>f</m> is not injective.

                Yes.  If <m>x_1</m> and <m>x_2</m> are two different elements of the domain <m>X</m>, then <m>f(x_1)</m> and <m>f(x_2)</m> must be different elements of <m>Y</m>, since <m>f</m> is injective.  Then <m>g(f(x_1))</m> must be different from <m>g(f(x_2))</m> since <m>g</m> is injective.  So no two distinct elements from the domain will have the same image.
              </p></li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Yes.  We know that every element of <m>Z</m> is the image of at least one element from <m>Y</m> under <m>g</m>.  But every element from <m>Y</m> is the image of some element in <m>X</m> under <m>f</m>.  So every element from <m>Z</m> is the image of at least one element from <m>X</m> under <m>g\circ f</m>.

                <p>
                  We know that <m>f</m> must be injective, and <m>g</m> could or could not be injective.
                  Note that if <m>f</m> was not injective, then there would be two elements in <m>X</m> that went to the same element in <m>Y</m> and that element would need to go to one element in <m>Z</m>, contradicting that <m>g\circ f</m> was injective.
                  However, consier <m>X = \{1,2\}</m>, <m>Y = \{a, b, c\}</m> and <m>Z = \{5, 6\}</m>, together with <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2}{a, b}</m> and <m>g = \twoline{a \amp b \amp c}{5, 6, 6}</m>.
                  It is easy to see that <m>g \circ f</m> is still injective even though <m>g</m> is not.

                  Now we know that <m>g</m> must be surjective, but <m>f</m> does not need to be (although it could be).
                  If there is an element in <m>Z</m> that is not the image of anything in <m>Y</m> under <m>g</m>, then that element certainly could not be the image of anything in <m>X</m> under <m>g\circ f</m>.
                  Note that the counterexample from the previous part also shows that <m>f</m> does not need to be surjective to make <m>g\circ f</m> surjective.

                    Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be elements of the domain <m>\Z</m>. Assume <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even, then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>. Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>, we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>. Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd, then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>. The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd (or visa-versa). But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even, so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>. Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>, which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>. Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd, so <m>f(n) = n-3 = y+3-3 = y</m> as desired. Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>. Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even, so <m>f(n) = n+1 = y-1+1 = y</m> as needed. Therefore <m>f</m> is surjective.

            This cannot be a function. If the domain were the set of cards, then it is not a function because not every card gets dealt to a player. If the domain were the set of players, it would not be a function because a single player would get mapped to multiple cards. Since this is not a function, it doesn't make sense to say whether it is injective/surjective/bijective.

        </hint>

        <solution>
          <p>
            With zero people in the room, there are no handshakes.  So the initial condition is <m>f(0) = 0</m>.  Now suppose there are <m>n</m> people in the room, and they have already shaken hands with each other.  There have been <m>f(n)</m> handshakes already.  Another person enters the room.  They must shake hands with all <m>n</m> people, so there are <m>n</m> more handshakes.
