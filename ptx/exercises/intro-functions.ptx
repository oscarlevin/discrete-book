                  This is neither injective nor surjective.
                  It is not injective because more than one element from the domain has 3 as its image.
                  It is not surjective because there are elements of the codomain (1, 2, 4, and 5) that are not images of anything from the domain.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is a bijection.
                  Every element in the codomain is the image of <em>exactly</em>
                  one element of the domain.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is a bijection.
                  Note that we can write this function in two line notation as <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{5 \amp 4 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 1}</m>.
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  In two line notation,
                  this function is <m>f = \twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5}{1 \amp 1 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp 3}</m>.
                  From this we can quickly see it is neither injective
                  (for example, 1 is the image of both 1 and 2)
                  nor surjective
                  (for example, 4 is not the image of anything).

                then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>.
                The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd
                (or visa-versa).
                But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even,
                so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
                Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>,
                which proves that <m>f</m> is injective.

                There are two cases: First, if <m>y</m> is even, then let <m>n = y+3</m>.
                Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd,

                Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>.
                Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even,

        Give a recursive definition for this function.

    <hint>

        To find the recurrence relation,

    <solution>
      <p>
        With zero people in the room, there are no handshakes.
        So the initial condition is <m>f(0) = 0</m>.

        There have been <m>f(n)</m> handshakes already.

        In general, there is no relationship between

        This is because <m>B</m> might contain elements that are not in the range of <m>f</m>,
        so we might even have <m>f\inv(B) = \emptyset</m>.
        On the other hand,
        there might be lots of elements from the domain that all get sent to a few elements in <m>B</m>,
        making <m>f\inv(B)</m> larger than <m>B</m>.

      <p>
        More specifically, if <m>f</m> is injective,

        (since every element in <m>B</m> must come from at most one element from the domain).

              This is always true.
              To prove it,
              first consider an arbitrary element <m>y \in f(A \cup B)</m>.
              Then <m>y = f(x)</m> for some <m>x \in A \cup B</m>.
              If <m>x \in A</m>, then <m>y \in f(A)</m>.
              If <m>x \in B</m>, then <m>y \in f(B)</m>.
              So in either case, <m>y \in f(A) \cup f(B)</m>.
              On the other hand, suppose <m>y \in f(A) \cup f(B)</m>.
              Then <m>y \in f(A)</m> or <m>y \in f(B)</m>.
              In the first, case, <m>y = f(x)</m> for some <m>x \in A</m>.
              But then <m>x \in A \cup B</m> so <m>y \in f(A \cup B)</m>.
              By the same argument,
              if <m>y \in f(B)</m> we also have <m>y \in f(A \cup B)</m>.

              (or anything)
              in common, but their images might.
              For example,
