                If <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both even,
                then <m>f(x) = x+1</m> and <m>f(y) = y+1</m>.
                Since <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>,
                we have <m>x + 1 = y + 1</m> which implies that <m>x = y</m>.
                Similarly, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both odd,
                then <m>x - 3 = y-3</m> so again <m>x = y</m>.
                The only other possibility is that <m>x</m> is even an <m>y</m> is odd
                (or visa-versa).
                But then <m>x + 1</m> would be odd and <m>y - 3</m> would be even,
                so it cannot be that <m>f(x) = f(y)</m>.
                Therefore if <m>f(x) = f(y)</m> we then have <m>x = y</m>,

                Since <m>y</m> is even, <m>n</m> is odd,

                Second, if <m>y</m> is odd, then let <m>n = y-1</m>.
                Since <m>y</m> is odd, <m>n</m> is even,
