        In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon.

        The main thing to realize is that we don't know the colors of these two shapes,

        We could have a square that was not blue but a green triangle.
        Or we could have a square that was not blue and a triangle that was not green.
        The case in which the square is blue but the triangle is not green cannot occur,
        as that would make the statement false.

            The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary.  So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary.

      	<solution>
          <p>
            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

          <p>
            We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.  Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
