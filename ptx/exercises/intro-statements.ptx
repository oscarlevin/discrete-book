        Of course there are many answers.
        It helps to assume that the statement is true and the converse is <em>not</em> true.
        Think about what that means in the real world and then start saying it in different ways.
        Some ideas: Use <q>necessary and sufficient</q> language,
        use <q>only if,</q> consider negations,

            The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary.  So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary.

          <p>
            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

          <p>
            We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.  Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
