            For each sentence below,
            decide whether it is an atomic statement,
            a molecular statement, or not a statement at all.

            <ol>
              <li>

              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  The customers wore shoes and they wore socks. <var name="$molecular" form="popup"/>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is not a statement.
                  It is an imperative sentence,
                  but is not either true or false.
                  It doesn't matter that this might actually be the rule or not.
                  Note that <q>The rule is that all customers must wear shoes</q>
                  <em>is</em> a statement.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is a statement, as it is either true or false.
                  It is an atomic statement because it cannot be divided into smaller statements.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is again a statement, but this time it is molecular.
                  In fact, it is a conjunction,
                  as we can write it as <q>The customers wore shoes and the customers wore socks.</q>

                  It is impossible to tell.
                  The hypothesis of the implication is true.
                  Thus the implication will be true if the conclusion is true (if 13 <em>is</em>
                  my favorite number) and false otherwise.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is true, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not.
                  Any implication with a true conclusion is true.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is true,
                  again, no matter whether 13 is my favorite number or not.
                  Any implication with a false hypothesis is true.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  For a disjunction to be true,
                  we just need one or the other
                  (or both)
                  of the parts to be true.
                  Thus this is a true statement.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We cannot tell.
                  The statement would be true if 13 is my favorite number,
                  and false if not
                  (since a conjunction needs both parts to be true to be true).
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is definitely false. 13 is prime,
                  so its negation (13 is not prime) is false.
                  At least one part of the conjunction is false,
                  so the whole statement is false.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This is true.
                  Either 13 is my favorite number or it is not, but whichever it is,
                  at least one part of the disjunction is true,
                  so the whole statement is true.

            In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon.
            One is a square, and the other is a triangle.
            Each shape is drawn in a single color.
            Suppose you believe me when I tell you that
            <em>if the square is blue,
            then the triangle is green</em>.
            What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The square and the triangle are both blue. <var name="$false" form="popup"/>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>

                  The square and the triangle are both green. <var name="$na" form="popup"/>
                </p>

              <li>
                <p>
                  If the triangle is not green,
                  then the square is not blue. <var name="$true" form="popup"/>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  If the triangle is green,
                  then the square is blue. <var name="$na" form="popup"/>
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  The square is not blue or the triangle is green. <var name="$true" form="popup"/>
                </p>
              </li>
            </ol>

        <solution>
          <p>
            The main thing to realize is that we don't know the colors of these two shapes,
            but we do know that we are in one of three cases: We could have a blue square and green triangle.
            We could have a square that was not blue but a green triangle.
            Or we could have a square that was not blue and a triangle that was not green.
            The case in which the square is blue but the triangle is not green cannot occur,
            as that would make the statement false.

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This must be false.
                  In fact, this is the negation of the original implication.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  This might be true or might be false.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  True.
                  This is the contrapositive of the original statement,
                  which is logically equivalent to it.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  We do not know.
                  This is the converse of the original statement.
                  In particular,
                  if the square is not blue but the triangle is green,
                  then the original statement is true but the converse is false.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <p>
                  True.
                  This is logically equivalent to the original statement.
                </p>

            <q>if a graph satisfies <em>condition (V)</em>,
            then the graph is <em>viscous</em>.</q>

                  The claim that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> means that <m>P(n)</m> is true no matter what <m>n</m> you consider in the domain of discourse.
                  Thus the only way to prove that
                  <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true is to check or otherwise argue that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n</m> in the domain.

                <p>
                  To prove <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is false all you need is one example of an element in the domain for which <m>P(n)</m> is false.
                  This is often called a <term>counterexample</term>.

              <li>
                <p>
                  We are simply claiming that there is some element <m>n</m> in the domain of discourse for which <m>P(n)</m> is true.
                  If you can find one such element,
                  you have verified the claim.

                <p>
                  Here we are claiming that no element we find will make <m>P(n)</m> true.
                  The only way to be sure of this is to verify that <em>every</em>
                  element of the domain makes <m>P(n)</m> false.
                  Note that the level of proof needed for this statement is the same as to prove that <m>\forall x P(x)</m> is true.

Consider the predicate <m>x = 5</m>. So <m>P(x)</m> is true if and only if <m>x = 5</m>. Certainly it is true that <m>\exists x P(x)</m> (since we can take <m>x = 5</m>), but false that <m>\forall x P(x)</m>.

                This says that everything has a square root (every element is the square of something). This is true of the positive real numbers, and also of the complex numbers. It is false of the natural numbers though, as for <m>x = 2</m> there is no natural number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^2 = 2</m>.

              <p>
                This asserts that between every pair of numbers there is some number strictly between them. This is true of the rationals (and reals) but false of the integers. If <m>x = 1</m> and <m>y = 2</m>, then there is nothing we can take for <m>z</m>.

In fact, if the domain contains <m>\{1,2,3, 4\}</m>, then no matter what we take <m>x</m> to be, there will be a pair that <m>x</m> is <em>not</em> between. However, the set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> as our domain makes the statement true. Let <m>x = 2</m>. Then no matter what <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> we pick, if <m>y \lt  z</m>, then 2 is between them.
