							You can always color the first vertex blue. None of the neighbors of this vertex could be neighbors with each other, for this would create a cycle. So all the neighbors can be colored red. Now all the (uncolored) neighbors of the red vertices can be colored blue <ndash /> the only way this would fail is if one was already adjacent to the first vertex (but this is impossible because we already colored all its neighbors) or adjacent to each other, but this would create a cycle.

					<!-- <solution>
						<p>
							This proof is very similar to showing that every tree is a bipartite graph.

						<proof>
							<p>
								Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>A tree with <m>n</m> vertices has a chromatic number of 2</q>
				</p>

							<p>
								Base Case: Consider a tree with <m>3</m> vertices. Since trees cannot have a cycle and two of the vertices are adjacent to the third vertex, we must have a coloring with 2 colors.
							</p>

							<p>
								Inductive Case: Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k\lt n</m>. Now, I need to show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. So, I can assume that I have a tree with <m>k+1</m> vertices and I must show that it has chromatic number 2. Now, if I remove one of leaf from the tree with <m>k+1</m> vertices I will be removing exactly 1 edge and 1 vertex. Therefore I have a tree with <m>k</m> vertices which I know by my inductive hypothesis must have a chromatic number of 2. Now, I can add that leaf back in, and since it's only attached to exactly one vertex which is colored one of the 2 colors, I can color the added vertex the opposite color and still have a chromatic number of 2. TBTPOMI <m>P(k+1)</m> is true for all <m>n\geq 3</m>.

        Note that you cannot use the 4-color theorem, or Brooke's theorem, or the clique number here.  In fact, this graph, called the <em>Grötzsch graph</em> is the smallest graph with chromatic number 4 that does not contain any triangles.

        Prove by induction on vertices that any graph <m>G</m> which contains at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m>
        (the maximal degree of all vertices in <m>G</m>)
        has chromatic number at most <m>\Delta(G)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
<!-- <solution>

<proof>
<p>
Let <m>G</m> be a graph with <m>n</m> vertices, maximal degree <m>\Delta(G)</m> and at least one vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m>. Assume for the sake of induction that all graphs <m>G'</m> with fewer than <m>n</m> vertices and a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m> have chromatic number less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>.

		Find a vertex of <m>G</m> with degree less than <m>\Delta(G)</m> and remove it. This forms a subgraph <m>G'</m> which has <m>n-1</m> vertices. Also, since we removed edges, we know that <m>\Delta(G') \le \Delta(G)</m>. If these maximal degrees are equal, then <m>G'</m> must also have a vertex of degree less than <m>\Delta(G')</m>, since at least one of its vertices had one more edge in <m>G</m>. In this case, we can apply our inductive hypothesis to produce a coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors. If <m>\Delta(G') \lt  \Delta(G)</m>, then we also can easily find a proper coloring of the vertices of <m>G'</m> using just <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors by starting with any vertex and coloring it and all of its neighbors differently, and then fanning out. Thus <m>G'</m> has a proper vertex coloring using just <m>\Delta(G)</m>-many colors.

		Now move back to <m>G</m>. Put the removed vertex back into the graph. Since it is adjacent to at most <m>\Delta(G) - 1</m> other vertices, there will be one of the <m>\Delta(G)</m> colors that is not present among its neighbors, which we could use to color the newly inserted vertex.

        If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex,
        and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet,
        we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2
        (for example,
        <m>D</m> would be adjacent to both <m>C</m> and <m>E</m>).
        By Brooks' theorem,
        this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle.

        Prove that if you color every edge of <m>K_6</m> either red or blue,
        you are guaranteed a monochromatic triangle
        (that is, an all red or an all blue triangle).
      </p>
    </statement>
<!-- <solution>

<proof>
<p>
Start with a single vertex of <m>K_6</m>, call it <m>v_0</m>. There are five edges incident to <m>v_0</m>, and by the pigeonhole principle, three of these must be colored identically. Without loss of generality, say these edges are <m>(v_0, v_1)</m>, <m>(v_0, v_2)</m> and <m>(v_0,v_3)</m>, and are colored red. Consider the edges <m>(v_1,v_2)</m>, <m>(v_2,v_3)</m>, and <m>(v_3, v_1)</m>. If any of these are colored red, we would have a monochromatic red triangle (it plus the two edges incident to <m>v_0</m>). If they are all colored blue, then we have a monochromatic blue triangle (those three edges). Either way, we are guaranteed to monochromatic triangle.
