        <p>
          We have characteristic polynomial <m>x^2 - 2x + 1</m>, which has <m>x = 1</m> as the only repeated root.  Thus using the characteristic root technique for repeated roots, the general solution is <m>a_n = a + bn</m> where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> depend on the initial conditions.
        <ol>
          <li><m>a_n = 1 + n</m>.</li>
          <li>

              For every <m>x</m>.  Take <m>a_0 = x-9</m> and <m>a_1 = x-8</m>.  The key here is to realize that no matter what the initial conditions are, the sequence given by this recurrence relation will be an arithmetic sequence with those initial terms.
