    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the sequence <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>. Explain how you know the closed formula for the sequence will be quadratic. Then <q>guess</q> the correct formula by comparing this sequence to the squares <m>1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots</m> (do not use polynomial fitting).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The first differences are <m>2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots</m>, and the second differences are <m>2, 2, 2, \ldots</m>. Thus the original sequence is <m>\Delta^2</m>-constant, so can be fit to a quadratic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Call the original sequence <m>a_n</m>. Consider <m>a_n - n^2</m>. This gives <m>0, -1, -2, -3, \ldots</m>. <em>That</em> sequence has closed formula <m>1-n</m> (starting at <m>n = 1</m>) so we have <m>a_n - n^2 = 1-n</m> or equivalently <m>a_n = n^2 - n + 1</m>.
        </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Use a similar technique as in the previous exercise to find a closed formula for the sequence <m>2, 11, 34, 77, 146, 247,\ldots</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          This is a <m>\Delta^3</m>-constant sequence. If we subtract off <m>n^3</m>, we are left with <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>, the sequence from the previous question. Thus here the closed formula is <m>n^3 + n^2 - n + 1</m>.

                <m>a_{n-1} = (n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 4 = n^2 + n + 2</m>. Thus <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2n+2</m>. Note that this is linear (arithmetic). We can check that we are correct. The sequence <m>a_n</m> is <m>4, 8, 14, 22, 32, \ldots</m> and the sequence of differences is thus <m>4, 6, 8, 10,\ldots</m> which agrees with <m>2n+2</m> (if we start at <m>n = 1</m>).

          <solution>
            <p>
              <m>a_{n-1} = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c</m>. Therefore <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2an - a + b</m>, which is arithmetic. Notice that this is not quite the derivative of <m>a_n</m>, which would be <m>2an + b</m>, but it is close.

          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              No. The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant.

          <statement>
            <p>
              Will the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences of <m>2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots</m> ever be constant? Explain.
            </p>
          </statement>
          <solution>
            <p>
              No. The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula <m>2\cdot 3^n</m>. This is an exponential function, which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree. If the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences was constant, then the closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.
