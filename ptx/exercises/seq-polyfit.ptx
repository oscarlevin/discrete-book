                Notice that the third differences are constant, so <m>a_n = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d</m>. Use the terms of the sequence to solve for <m>a, b, c,</m> and <m>d</m> to get <m>a_n = \frac{1}{6} (12+11 n+6 n^2+n^3)</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the sequence <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>. Explain how you know the closed formula for the sequence will be quadratic. Then <q>guess</q> the correct formula by comparing this sequence to the squares <m>1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots</m> (do not use polynomial fitting).
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The first differences are <m>2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots</m>, and the second differences are <m>2, 2, 2, \ldots</m>. Thus the original sequence is <m>\Delta^2</m>-constant, so can be fit to a quadratic.
        </p>

        <p>
          Call the original sequence <m>a_n</m>. Consider <m>a_n - n^2</m>. This gives <m>0, -1, -2, -3, \ldots</m>. <em>That</em> sequence has closed formula <m>1-n</m> (starting at <m>n = 1</m>) so we have <m>a_n - n^2 = 1-n</m> or equivalently <m>a_n = n^2 - n + 1</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Use a similar technique as in the previous exercise to find a closed formula for the sequence <m>2, 11, 34, 77, 146, 247,\ldots</m>.

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          This is a <m>\Delta^3</m>-constant sequence. If we subtract off <m>n^3</m>, we are left with <m>1, 3, 7, 13, 21, \ldots</m>, the sequence from the previous question. Thus here the closed formula is <m>n^3 + n^2 - n + 1</m>.

          Note, in the picture on the right, there are some cannonballs (actually just one) you cannot see. The next picture would have 4 cannonballs you cannot see. The stacks are <em>not</em> hollow.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pirates wonder how many cannonballs would be required to build a pyramid 15 layers high (thus breaking the world cannonball stacking record). Can you help?
        </p>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Let <m>P(n)</m> denote the number of cannonballs needed to create a pyramid <m>n</m> layers high. So <m>P(1) = 1</m>, <m>P(2) = 4</m>, and so on. Calculate <m>P(3)</m>, <m>P(4)</m> and <m>P(5)</m>.

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  To get the next larger pyramid, we add a triangle of cannonballs to the previous pyramid. Thus to get <m>P(n)</m>, we add <m>P(n-1)</m> to the <m>n</m>th triangular number:
                  <m>P(3) = 4 + 6 = 10</m>, <m>P(4) = 10 + 10 = 20</m>, <m>P(5) = 20 + 15 = 35</m>.

                  The first differences are <m>3, 6, 10, 15, \ldots</m>. The second differences are <m>3, 4, 5, 6, \ldots</m>. The third differences are <m>1,1,1,\ldots</m>. Since third differences are constant, we know the closed formula for <m>P(n)</m> will be a degree 3 polynomial. So <m>P(n) = an^3 + b n^2 + cn + d</m>. Note that <m>P(0) = 0</m>, so <m>d = 0</m>. To solve for <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m>, we solve the system of equations:

                </p>

                <p>
                  Doing so gives <m>a = \frac{1}{6}</m>, <m>b = \frac{1}{2}</m> and <m>c = \frac{1}{3}</m> so

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Suppose <m>a_n = n^2 + 3n + 4</m>. Find a closed formula for the sequence of differences by computing <m>a_n - a_{n-1}</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          <m>a_{n-1} = (n-1)^2 + 3(n-1) + 4 = n^2 + n + 2</m>. Thus <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2n+2</m>. Note that this is linear (arithmetic). We can check that we are correct. The sequence <m>a_n</m> is <m>4, 8, 14, 22, 32, \ldots</m> and the sequence of differences is thus <m>4, 6, 8, 10,\ldots</m> which agrees with <m>2n+2</m> (if we start at <m>n = 1</m>).

          Repeat the above assuming this time <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>. That is, prove that every quadratic sequence has arithmetic differences.

      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          <m>a_{n-1} = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c</m>. Therefore <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = 2an - a + b</m>, which is arithmetic. Notice that this is not quite the derivative of <m>a_n</m>, which would be <m>2an + b</m>, but it is close.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Can you use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the <m>n</m>th term of the sequence 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47,
          <ellipsis/>? Explain why or why not.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          No. The sequence of differences is the same as the original sequence so no differences will be constant.

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Will the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences of <m>2, 6, 18, 54, 162, \ldots</m> ever be constant? Explain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          No. The sequence is geometric, and in fact has closed formula <m>2\cdot 3^n</m>. This is an exponential function, which is not equal to any polynomial of any degree. If the <m>n</m>th sequence of differences was constant, then the closed formula for the original sequence would be a degree <m>n</m> polynomial.

        <p>
          Consider the sequences <m>2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408,\ldots</m> (with <m>a_0 = 2</m>).

                Describe the rate of growth of this sequence.

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  It does not seem to help to look at the difference between terms - in fact, the differences seem to be growing in the same manner as the original sequence. However, looking at the ratio between terms gives us almost a common ratio of 2. In other words, it appears that the sequence is growing exponentially.

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  We see that <m>5</m> is a little more than twice the previous term, and 12 is a little more than twice 5. In fact, it is exactly 2 more, which is the first term. So perhaps <m>a_n = 2a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}</m>, and this seems to work moving forward.

                Find a closed formula for the sequence.


              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  Use the characteristic root technique. The characteristic equation is <m>x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0</m>. Solving this (using the quadratic formula) gives <m>x = 1\pm\sqrt{2}</m>. So we know that the closed formula for <m>a_n = a(1+\sqrt{2})^n + b(1-\sqrt{2})^n</m>. Now let's find <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. We have
                  <me>
                    2 = a + b
                  </me>
              </p>
                <me>
                  5 = a(1+\sqrt{2}) + b(1-\sqrt{2})
                </me>
                <p>
                  Use substitution: <m>a = 2-b</m> so <m>5 = (2-b)(1+\sqrt 2) + b(1-\sqrt{2})</m> which simplifies to <m>b = \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{4}</m>. This gives <m>a = \frac{4 - 3\sqrt 2}{4}</m>. Therefore
                  <me>
                    a_n = \frac{4-3\sqrt{2}}{4}(1+\sqrt{2})^n + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{4}(1-\sqrt{2})^n
                  </me>

              <p>
                If you look at the sequence of differences between terms, and then the sequence of second differences, the sequence of third differences, and so on, will you ever get a constant sequence? Explain how you know.

              <!-- <solution>
                <p>
                  You will never get a constant sequence of differences. If you did, this would mean that the original sequence would be some polynomial. But we have an exponential closed formula, so no polynomial will fit.
