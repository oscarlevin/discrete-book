      <statement>
        <p>
          Use induction to prove for all <m>n \in \N</m> that <m>\d\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            We must prove that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \cdots +2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m> for all <m>n \in \N</m>. Thus let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 1</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>, which claims that <m>1 = 2^{0+1} -1</m>. Since <m>2^1 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1</m>, we see that <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1</m>. We must show that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true (i.e., that <m>1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^{k+1} = 2^{k+2} - 1</m>). To do this, we start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \cdots + 2^k + 2^{k+1} = \amp ~ 2^{k+1} - 1 + 2^{k+1} \amp \text{by inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~2\cdot 2^{k+1} - 1 \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> = \amp ~ 2^{k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

      <statement>
        <p>
          Prove that <m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6 for all <m>n \in \N</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q><m>7^n - 1</m> is a multiple of 6.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>. First we establish the base case, <m>P(0)</m>. Since <m>7^0 - 1 = 0</m>, and <m>0</m> is a multiple of 6, <m>P(0)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> holds for an arbitrary <m>k \in \N</m>. That is, <m>7^k - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words, <m>7^k - 1 = 6j</m> for some integer <m>j</m>. Now consider <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m>:
            <md>
              <mrow> 7^{k+1} - 1 ~ \amp = 7^{k+1} - 7 + 6 \amp \text{by cleverness:} -1 = -7 + 6</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(7^k - 1) + 6 \amp \text{factor out a 7 from the first two terms}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 7(6j) + 6 \amp \text{by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = 6(7j + 1) \amp \text{factor out a 6}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore <m>7^{k+1} - 1</m> is a multiple of 6, or in other words, <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        <p>
          Prove that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m> for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>1+3 +5 + \cdots + (2n-1) = n^2</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>. First the base case, <m>P(1)</m>. We have <m>1 = 1^2</m> which is true, so <m>P(1)</m> is established. Now the inductive case. Assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. That is, <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) = k^2</m>. We will now prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is also true (i.e., that <m>1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k+1) = (k+1)^2</m>). We start with the left-hand side of <m>P(k+1)</m> and work to the right-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> 1 + 3 + 5 + \cdots + (2k-1) + (2k+1) ~ \amp = k^2 + (2k+1) \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = (k+1)^2 \amp \text{by factoring}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> holds, so by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

          Prove that <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1</m> where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2n} = F_{2n+1} - 1</m>. We will show that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>. First the base case is easy because <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_1 = 1</m> so <m>F_0 = F_1 - 1</m>. Now consider the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true, that is, assume <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k} = F_{2k+1} - 1</m>. To establish <m>P(k+1)</m> we work from left to right:
            <md>
              <mrow> F_0 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{2k} + F_{2k+2} ~ \amp = F_{2k+1} - 1 + F_{2k+2} \amp \text{by ind. hyp.}</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = F_{2k+1} + F_{2k+2} - 1 \amp</mrow>
              <mrow> \amp = F_{2k+3} - 1 \amp \text{by recursive def.}</mrow>
            </md>
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore <m>F_0 + F_2 + F_4 + \cdots + F_{2k+2} = F_{2k+3} - 1</m>, which is to say <m>P(k+1)</m> holds. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

          Prove that <m>2^n \lt  n!</m> for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. (Recall, <m>n! = 1\cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \cdots\cdot n</m>.)
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>2^n \lt  n!</m>. We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>. First, we check the base case and see that yes, <m>2^4 \lt  4!</m> (as <m>16 \lt  24</m>) so <m>P(4)</m> is true. Now for the inductive case. Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary <m>k \ge 4</m>. That is, <m>2^k \lt  k!</m>. Now consider <m>P(k+1)</m>: <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m>. To prove this, we start with the left side and work to the right side.

          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore <m>2^{k+1} \lt  (k+1)!</m> so we have established <m>P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 4</m>.

          Prove, by mathematical induction, that <m>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_{n} = F_{n+2} - 1</m>, where <m>F_n</m> is the <m>n</m>th Fibonacci number (<m>F_0 = 0</m>, <m>F_1 = 1</m> and <m>F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}</m>).

      </statement>
      <!-- <solution>
        <p>
          This is saying that if we add up the first <m>n</m> Fibonacci numbers, we will get another Fibonacci number (specifically, the <m>(n+2)</m>th one). Induction is a good idea here because it will be easy to just add one more Fibonacci number to the sum we already have. If we already have <m>F_{k+2}</m> and we add <m>F_{k+1}</m> we can use the recurrence relation to simplify this, becoming <m>F_{k+3}</m>.

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_n = F_{n+2} - 1</m>. We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Base case: <m>P(0)</m> states that <m>F_0 = F_2 - 1</m>, which is true because <m>F_0 = 0</m> and <m>F_2 = 1</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for an arbitrary fixed <m>k \ge 0</m>. That is,
            <me>
              F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_k = F_{k+2} - 1
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            We must prove that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well (i.e. that <m>F_0 + F_1 + \cdots +F_{k+1} = F_{k+3} - 1</m>). Start with the left-hand side:
            <md>
              <mrow> F_0 + F_1 + F_2 + \cdots + F_k + F_{k+1} \amp = F_{k+2} - 1 + F_{k+1} \amp \mbox{ by the inductive hypothesis}</mrow>

          <p>
            Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Zombie Euler and Zombie Cauchy, two famous zombie mathematicians, have just signed up for Twitter accounts. After one day, Zombie Cauchy has more followers than Zombie Euler. Each day after that, the number of new followers of Zombie Cauchy is exactly the same as the number of new followers of Zombie Euler (and neither lose any followers). Explain how a proof by mathematical induction can show that on every day after the first day, Zombie Cauchy will have more followers than Zombie Euler. That is, explain what the base case and inductive case are, and why they together prove that Zombie Cauchy will have more followers on the 4th day.
              </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <solution>
              <p>
                The idea here is that because we know Zombie Cauchy starts ahead, and each day increases by the same amount as Zombie Euler, he will always be ahead.
              </p>

              <p>
                The base case is that Zombie Cauchy has more followers than Zombie Euler on day 1. We know this is true because it says so in the problem.
              </p>

              <p>
                The inductive case is that <em>if</em> Zombie Cauchy has more followers on day <m>k</m>, then he will still have more followers on day <m>k+1</m>. We know this is true because each day, the Zombies receive an equal number of new followers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Together, the base case and inductive case show that on the 4th day, Zombie Cauchy will be ahead: he is ahead on day 1, and because on day 1 he is ahead, by the inductive case he will also be ahead on day 2. By the inductive case again, he will be ahead on day 3 since he is ahead on day 2, and since he is ahead on day 3, he will also be ahead on day 4. Of course we could keep doing this up to any day.

            <statement>
              <p>
                Find the largest number of points which a football team cannot get exactly using just 3-point field goals and 7-point touchdowns (ignore the possibilities of safeties, missed extra points, and two point conversions). Prove your answer is correct by mathematical induction.
              </p>
            </statement>
            <!-- <solution>
              <p>
                First note that it is impossible to make 11 points - if only field goals are made, the points must be a multiple of 3, if 1 touchdown is made, the possible point totals are 7, 10, 13, <ellipsis /> and two touchdowns are already too much.
              </p>

              <p>
                We will prove that 11 is the largest number of points which cannot be made. In other words, any number of points greater than or equal to 12 can be made.
              </p>

              <proof>
                <p>
                  Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>it is possible to make <m>n</m> points using touchdowns and field goals.</q> We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 12</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  First the base case: You can make 12 points with 4 field goals, so <m>P(12)</m> is true.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now the inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some fixed <m>k \ge 12</m>. That is, it is possible to make <m>k</m> points. Since <m>k \ge 12</m>, we must have made the <m>k</m> points using either at least 2 field goals or at least 2 touchdowns, or both (because if we used just one of each we would have only 10 points). Now if the <m>k</m> points were accomplished with 2 (or more) field goals, then replace 2 field goals with 1 touchdown. This increases to point total by 1, giving <m>k + 1</m> points. On the other hand, if the <m>k</m> points were accomplished with <m>2</m> (or more) touchdowns, replace 2 touchdowns with 5 field goals, again increasing the point total by 1, giving <m>k+1</m> points. Using one of these two substitutions, we can make <m>k+1</m> points, so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, establishing the inductive case.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 12</m>.

                This question is asking us to show that the sum of squares for <m>n</m> numbers can be found using the formula <m>\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}</m>. We can definitely see this is true for the first few instances, but we are really taking it on faith that it is true for the first <m>n</m> squares.

                  At this point it is advantageous to start on one side of the equality. So, choosing the left-hand side to start I shall manipulate it so that it looks like the right-hand side.

First we establish the base case: when <m>n = 0</m>, <m>P(n)</m> is true, because <m>0 \lt  100</m>. Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>k \lt  100</m>. Now if <m>k \lt  100</m>, then <m>k</m> is some number, like 80. Of course <m>80+1 = 81</m> which is still less than 100. So <m>k +1 \lt  100</m> as well.

Now for the inductive step, assume <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is there exists a strictly increasing sequence <m>a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_k</m> with <m>a_k \lt  100</m>. Now consider this sequence, plus one more term, <m>a_{k+1}</m> which is greater than <m>a_k</m> but less than <m>100</m>. Such a number exists, for example, the average between <m>a_k</m> and 100. So then <m>P(k+1)</m> is true, so we have shown that <m>P(k) \imp P(k+1)</m>. Thus by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

Note that <m>P(0)</m>, <m>P(1)</m>, <m>P(2)</m>, and <m>P(3)</m> are all true since <m>0, 1, 2, 3</m> are Fibonacci numbers. Suppose that <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt  n</m>. Now if <m>n</m> is a Fibonacci number, then <m>P(n)</m> is true. Otherwise, let <m>m</m> be the largest Fibonacci number less than <m>n</m>. Consider the number <m>n - m</m>. This is a number smaller than <m>n</m>, so <m>P(n-m)</m> is true. So wrote <m>n-m</m> either as a single Fibonacci number (if it is one) or as the sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. Adding the Fibonacci number <m>m</m> will give <m>n</m> as the sum of Fibonacci numbers. All that is left is to explain why this sum does not have any repeats (that the numbers are distinct). We know that there are no repeats in the sum for <m>n-m</m> by the inductive

But there must be a Fibonacci number between <m>m</m> and <m>2m</m> (since <m>m</m> plus the previous Fibonacci number is a Fibonacci number), and we picked <m>m</m> to be the largest Fibonacci number less than <m>n</m>. This would mean that <m>2m > n</m>, so there cannot be two <m>m</m>'s in the sum.

What happens if a <m>k+1</m>st person shows up?  How many <em>new</em> handshakes take place?  The new person must shake hands with everyone there, which is <m>k</m> new  handshakes.

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+n \choose n} = {5+n \choose n}</m>. For the base case, consider <m>n = 0</m>. This says <m>{4 \choose 0} = {5 \choose 0}</m>. Since these are both 1, the base case is true. Now for the inductive case, suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} = {5+k \choose k}</m>. If we add <m>{4+k+1 \choose k+1}</m> to both sides, we get
            <me>
              {4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}= {5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}
            </me>
          </p>

          <p>
            But <m>{5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1} = {5+k+1 \choose k+1}</m>. In other words, we have
            <me>
              {4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1} = {5+k+1 \choose k+1}
            </me>
            which is to say that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

          Use the product rule for logarithms (<m>\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)</m>) to prove, by induction on <m>n</m>, that <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>, for all natural numbers <m>n \ge 2</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The idea here is that if we take the logarithm of <m>a^n</m>, we can increase <m>n</m> by 1 if we multiply by another <m>a</m> (inside the logarithm). This results in adding 1 more <m>\log(a)</m> to the total.
        </p>

        <proof>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\log(a^n) = n \log(a)</m>. The base case, <m>P(2)</m> is true, because <m>\log(a^2) = \log(a\cdot a) = \log(a) + \log(a) = 2\log(a)</m>, by the product rule for logarithms. Now assume, for induction, that <m>P(k)</m> is true. That is, <m>\log(a^k) = k\log(a)</m>. Consider <m>\log(a^{k+1})</m>. We have
            <me>
              \log(a^{k+1}) = \log(a^k\cdot a) = \log(a^k) + \log(a) = k\log(a) + \log(a)
            </me>
            with the last equality due to the inductive hypothesis. But this simplifies to <m>(k+1) \log(a)</m>, establishing <m>P(k+1)</m>. Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

          You are allowed to assume the base case. For the inductive case, group all but the last function together as one sum of functions, then apply the usual sum of derivatives rule, and then the inductive hypothesis.

            (f_1f_2f_3 \cdots f_k f_{k+1})' = (f_1f_2f_3\cdots f_k)'f_{k+1} + (f_1f_2f_3\cdots f_k)f_{k+1}'
