        On the way to the market,
        you exchange your cow for some magic dark chocolate espresso beans.
        These beans have the property that every night at midnight,
        each bean splits into two, effectively doubling your collection.
        You decide to take advantage of this and each morning (around 8am) you eat 5 beans.

              If we have a number of beans ending in a 5 and we double it,
              we will get a number of beans ending in a 0
              (since <m>5\cdot 2 = 10</m> ).
              Then if we subtract 5, we will once again get a number of beans ending in a 5.
              Thus if on any day we have a number ending in a 5, the next day will also have a number ending in a 5.

              then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)).
              Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3.
              By part (a) again,

              The proof by induction would say that on <em>every</em>

          We will prove that <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \in \N</m>.

        Here's the idea:
        since every entry in Pascal's Triangle is the sum of the two entries above it,
        we can get the <m>k+1</m>st row by adding up all the pairs of entry from the <m>k</m>th row.
        But doing this uses each entry on the <m>k</m>th row twice.
        Thus each time we drop to the next row, we double the total.
        Of course, row 0 has sum <m>1 = 2^0</m>
        (the base case).
        Now try to make this precise with a formal induction proof.
        You will use the fact that
        <m>{n \choose k} = {n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m> for the inductive case.

    <solution permid="ppR">
      <p permid="WQO">
        To see why this works, try it on a copy of Pascal's triangle.
        We are adding up the entries along a diagonal,
        starting with the 1 on the left-hand side of the 4th row.
        Suppose we add up the first 5 entries on this diagonal.
        The claim is that the sum is the entry below and to the left of the last of these 5 entries.
        Note that if this is true, and we instead add up the first 6 entries,
        we will need to add the entry one spot to the right of the previous sum.
        But these two together give the entry below them,
        which is below and left of the last of the 6 entries on the diagonal.
        If you follow that, you can see what is going on.
        But it is not a great proof.
        A formal induction proof is needed:

      <proof permid="Vxa">
        <p permid="CXX">
          Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+n \choose n} = {5+n \choose n}</m>.
          For the base case, consider <m>n = 0</m>.
          This says <m>{4 \choose 0} = {5 \choose 0}</m>.
          Since these are both 1, the base case is true.
          Now for the inductive case, suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true.
          That is, <m>{4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} = {5+k \choose k}</m>.
          If we add <m>{4+k+1 \choose k+1}</m> to both sides, we get

            {4 \choose 0} + {5 \choose 1} + {6 \choose 2} + \cdots + {4+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}= {5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1}

        <p permid="jfg">
          But <m>{5+k \choose k} + {5+k \choose k+1} = {5+k+1 \choose k+1}</m>.
          In other words, we have

          which is to say that <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
          Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
