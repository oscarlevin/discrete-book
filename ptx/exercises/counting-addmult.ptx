        Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers
        <term>hexadecimal</term> or base 16.
        Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers:

            There are 64 words which start with <q>aha</q>
            and another 64 words that end with <q>bah.</q>
            Perhaps we over counted the words that both start with
            <q>aha</q> and end with <q>bah</q>,
            but since the words are only 5 letters long, there are no such words.

            The taboo word can be in any of three positions
            (starting with letter 1, 2, or 3)
            and for each position we must choose the other two letters
            (from the remaining 5 letters).

    <statement>
      <p permid="vpY">
        For how many three digit numbers (100 to 999) is the
        <em>sum of the digits</em> even? (For example,
        <m>343</m> has an even sum of digits:
        <m>3+4+3 = 10</m> which is even.) Find the answer and explain why it is correct in at least two
        <em>different</em> ways.
