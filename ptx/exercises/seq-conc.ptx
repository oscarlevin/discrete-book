                    The sequence of first differences is <m>4, 6, 8, 10, 12,\ldots</m>, so the sequence of second differences is <m>2, 2, 2,\ldots</m> which is constant. Thus we know that the original sequence will be a quadratic: <m>a_n = an^2 + bn + c</m>. We know <m>a_0 = 1</m> so we have <m>c = 1</m>. This gives the system

                  <p>
                    If we multiply the first equation by <m>-2</m> and add the second equation we get <m>1 = 2a - 1</m> so <m>a = 1</m>. Plugging this into the first equation gives <m>b = 3</m>. Thus the closed formula is <m>a_n = n^2 + 3n + 1</m>.

                    If we compare our sequence to the sequence of squares <m>1,4,9, 16, 25,\ldots</m> we see a difference of <m>4, 7, 10, 13, 16, \ldots</m>. These are each 1 more than a multiple of 3. So we see that the sequence <m>5, 11, 19, 29, 41, 55,\ldots</m> is just the sequence of squares plus the sequence given by <m>3n+1</m>. So

            Note that <m>1 = 2^0</m>; this is your base case. Now suppose <m>k</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>1\le k \le n</m>. We can then write <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 as follows: subtract the largest power of 2 less than <m>n</m> from <m>n</m>. That is, write <m>n = 2^j + k</m> for the largest possible <m>j</m>. But <m>k</m> is now less than <m>n</m>, and also less than <m>2^j</m>, so write <m>k</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 (we can do so by the inductive hypothesis). Thus <m>n</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            Prove using induction that every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets for any <m>n \ge 1</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement, <q>every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets.</q> We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            <u>Base case</u>: Any set with 1 element <m>\{a\}</m> has exactly 2 subsets: the empty set and the set itself. Thus the number of subsets is <m>2= 2^1</m>. Thus <m>P(1)</m> is true.

            <u>Inductive case</u>: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>. Thus every set containing exactly <m>k</m> elements has <m>2^k</m> different subsets. Now consider a set containing <m>k+1</m> elements: <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}</m>. Any subset of <m>A</m> must either contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> or not. In other words, a subset of <m>A</m> is just a subset of <m>\{a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_k\}</m> with or without <m>a_{k+1}</m>. Thus there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> and another <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which do not contain <m>a^{k+1}</m>. This gives a total of <m>2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m>. But our choice of <m>A</m> was arbitrary, so this works for any subset containing <m>k+1</m> elements, so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction, <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
