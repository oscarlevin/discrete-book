              You need 10 coins.
              You could have 3 pennies, 3 nickels, and 3 dimes.
              The 10th coin must either be a quarter,
              giving you 4 coins that are all different,
              or else a 4th penny, nickel or dime.
              To prove this,
              assume you don't have 4 coins that are all the same or all different.
              In particular, this says that you only have 3 coin types,
              and each of those types can only contain 3 coins,
              for a total of 9 coins, which is less than 10.

        Are there any trolls that are not scared of goats?
        Recall, of course, that all trolls are either knights

        or knaves
        (who always lie).
