        Let <m>G</m> be a connected graph with <m>v</m> vertices and <m>e</m> edges.  Use mathematical induction to prove that if <m>G</m> contains exactly one cycle (among other edges and vertices), then <m>v = e</m>.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Note: this is asking you to prove a special case of Euler's formula for planar graphs, so do not use that formula in your proof.

    </statement>
    <hint>
      <p>
        You might want to give the proof in two parts.  First prove by induction that the cycle <m>C_n</m> has <m>v=e</m>.  Then consider what happens if the graph is more than just the cycle.

                <p>
                  Assume for a contradiction that every tree with at least 3 vertices does not have a leaf. Namely, that there are no vertices of degree 1. Then, every vertex must have a degree of 2 or more, but this would imply that we have a cycle! Why? Think about taking a path from one vertex to another. Choose the first vertex and a route to leave it (remember it should have at least two ways to leave). Once I leave that vertex I reach another vertex which also has at least one more way to leave. Keep doing this. Eventually you will get back to one of the vertices that you have already visited and therefore you will have completed a cycle.

              Consider what happens when you cut off a leaf and then let it regrow.

                  Recall that we need two parts for an induction proof: a base case and an inductive case.

                <proof>
                  <p>
                    Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <q>a tree graph <m>T_n</m> with <m>n</m> vertices has <m>n-1</m> edges.</q> Base Case: Draw a tree with three vertices. Clearly you have only 2 edges (otherwise you would have a cycle).
            </p>

                  <p>
                    Inductive Case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>3\lt k\lt n</m>.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    NTS: <m>P(k+1)</m> is true. That is <m>T_{k+1}</m> has <m>k</m> edges.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Let <m>T_{k+1}</m> be a tree graph with <m>k+1</m> vertices. By part (b) we know that every tree with at least 3 vertices has a leaf, so cut that one leaf off of <m>T_{k+1}</m>. Then our tree graph has only <m>k</m> vertices, and by our inductive case has <m>k-1</m> edges. Well, if we let that leaf regrow we will add both one edge and one vertex, which means that we will have a tree graph with <m>k+1</m> vertices and <m>k-1+1=k</m> edges. TBTPOMI we have shown that <m>P(n)</m> is true.
