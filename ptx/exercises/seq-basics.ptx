        So the closed formula agrees with the recurrence relation.
        The closed formula has initial terms <m>a_0 = 10</m> and <m>a_1 = 41</m>.

        Write out the first few terms of the sequence:
        <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,\ldots</m>.
        This is surprising at first,
        but note that we could write <m>2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} = a_{n-1} + (a_{n-1} -a_{n-2})</m>,
        and <m>a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}</m> is just the difference between the terms.
        Initially, the difference between terms is 1, so each time we are just adding one.
        So we see that <m>a_n = n</m> is the closed formula.

        Bonus: When bees play chess,
        they use a hexagonal board like the one shown below.
        The queen bee can move one space at a time either directly to the right or angled up-right or down-right
        (but can never move leftwards).
        How many different paths can the queen take from the top left hexagon to the bottom right hexagon?
        Explain your answer, and this relates to the previous question.
        (As an example,
        there are three paths to get to the second hexagon on the bottom row.)
