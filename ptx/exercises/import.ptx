                both premises are true.
                However, here the conclusion is false.
                Thus this is NOT a valid deduction rule.
                In fact, we can see exactly where it goes wrong: If <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> is false and <m>R</m> is true,
                we get a counterexample,
                since <m>Q</m> being false makes both premises true no matter what <m>R</m> is.

                  How does this problem relate to PIE?
                  <solution permid="MLi">
                    Remember that PIE is the principle of inclusion/exclusion and this problem relates because we want to calculate the total number of students who took the survey but we can't just add up all the numbers in the problem because we would be counting certain students multiple times. So, this means that when we are looking at this problem we need to follow the principle for 3 different sets which gives us:
                    <me permid="lJR">
                      |A\cup B \cup C|=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C| - |B \cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|
                    </me>
                    So, we could have just looked at the problem and related each set of students to each <m>A, B, C</m> where <m>A\cap B</m> is the number of students who did both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to get to school.

            Before our second kid, when we ate dinner,

                    There are 4 chairs for my daughter to sit in, then 3 for my wife, and 2 for me. So there are <m>4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24</m> seating arrangements. Note this is simply <m>P(4,3)</m>.

                  How many of the seating arrangements you found in the previous part have this property?
                  Explain.
                  <solution permid="YZA">
                    Let's say the normal arrangement of seats is ESMO (empty, Shannon, Maddie, Oscar).  It would not be too difficult to list all of the acceptable seating arrangements here.  In fact, we could list all 24, and cross out any that have one or more people in their usual seats.  Note that it is okay for E to be in the first spot, but S must be in a spot other than the second, M must be in spot other than the third, and O must be in a spot other than the 4th.  This is the list we would be left with:

                      EMOS, EOSM, SEOM, SOEM, SMOE, MEOS, MOES, MOSE, OESM, OMES, OMSE
                    </me>
                    If you wanted to count this using our counting techniques, you could use PIE.  Count the number of <em>unacceptable</em> arrangements and subtract that from 24:
                    <me permid="xYj">
                      24-\left[3\cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 1\right] = 11
                    </me>.
                    Here each <m>3\cdot 2</m> counts the number of ways that the other two people can sit if one person sits in their usual seat, the 2's count the number of choices for the last person when two people sit in their usual seat, and the 1 is the number of arrangements when all three people sit in their usual seat.

(b) and (d): 1.  (c) and (d): 2.  Combinations of 3?  (a), (b), and (c) can happen in 1 way, as can (b), (c), and (d), but the other two cannot happen.

            How many 10-digit numbers contain exactly four 1's, three 2's, two 3's and one 4?
            Find the answer in two different ways to establish a binomial identity.

              Some examples of acceptable outcomes: 1111222334, 1212121343, 4332221111, \ldots. Each of these has 10 digits (as the questions states), and the number of each type of digit is the same. It is just the arrangement that matters. So does order matter here? Maybe, but the order of what? The digits?

              How could I break the task of choosing an outcome into subtasks? One way would be to first select what goes in the first digit, then in the second, etc. In this sense order does matter. Does that work? Well there are 4 choices for the first digit. For the second digit there are... well it depends on what I choose for the first digit. So this doesn't work. Let's try something else
            </p>

            <p permid="brQ">
              What if I first select where I put the 4.
              It could go 1st, 2nd, etc.
              There are 10 spots.
              Thus 10, or maybe <m>{10 \choose 1}</m>.
              Now where can I put the 3's.
              It doesn't matter which 3 I place first,
              so here order does not matter.
              I've already filled up one spot with a 4, so there are 9 spots left and I need 2 of them.
              So <m>{9 \choose 2}</m>.
              Ah, then <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> to pick the three spots to put the 2's and
              <m>{4 \choose 4}</m> choices of where to put the four 1's.
              Now do I add or multiply?
              Well to get my 10 digit number I need to do all these subtasks,
              not just one of them, so definitely multiply.
              Thus the answer is
              <me permid="qtK">
                {10 \choose 1}{9 \choose 2}{7 \choose 3}{4 \choose 4} = 12600
              </me>
              Oh wait, what if I picked where the 1's went first?
              There are <m>{10 \choose 4}</m> spots,
              which leaves <m>{6 \choose 3}</m> choices for where to put the 2's, and
              <m>{3 \choose 2}</m> for the 3's and <m>{1 \choose 1}</m> for the 4.
              So now it looks like the answer should be
              <me permid="WAT">
                {10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}{1 \choose 1}

              Which is it?
              Oh wait, those are the same.

              Let me check one more thing.
              Did I get everything?
              Did I double count?
              Maybe let's try building one of the outcomes using the answer
              (the first one).
              The first thing I do is pick on of 10 things.  10 spots.
              So for example, I could pick this:
              <me permid="CIc">
                - - - - - ~ 4 - - - -
              </me>
              Next I pick 2 out of 9 things.
              Those 9 things are\ldots, the 9 remaining spots.
              What do I do with the 2 that I pick?
              I put in 3's.
              So maybe:
              <me permid="iPl">
                3 - - - - ~ 4 - 3 - -
              </me>
              Yeah, and I was right to use
              <m>{9 \choose 2}</m> instead of <m>P(9,2)</m> because it does not matter if I pick the 1st spot and then the 8th,
              or the 8th and then the 1st.
              Next I choose 3 out of 7\ldots spots to\ldots put 2's into.
              Maybe I get
              <me permid="OWu">
                3 - 2 2 - 4 - 3 - 2
              </me>
              and then put the 1's in the remaining 4 spots - <m>{4 \choose 4} = 1</m>, and yes,
              there is just one way to finish up:
              <me permid="vdD">
                3 1 22141312
              </me>
              And that is an acceptable outcome.
              Double yay.

            Hint: this is intended to be a question about sequences.

            <solution permid="aON">
              Start with <m>P_2</m> (a pair of adjacent vertices). There are exactly 3 independent sets: the empty set and the two sets that contain just one vertex. Now for <m>P_3</m>, think of adding in 1 vertex to the end of <m>P_2</m>. We could put this new vertex in the independent set or not. If we keep it out, then each independent set we had before is still independent (so that is 3 already). If we put it in, then we only have 2 choices: put the vertex on the other end in or not. Thus there are a total of 5 independent sets

              If we keep this vertex out,
              we could use any of the 5 independent sets of <m>P_3</m>.
              If we put it in, then we cannot put the vertex next to it in,

              But that looks just like <m>P_2</m>,

                {\bf BONUS:} Clu D. Tector was lecturing on methods for detecting counterfeit coins.
                To illustrate a point he removed four coins from his pocket,
                one of which is either heavier or lighter than the rest
                (in other words, it was counterfeit).
                He then pulled a fifth coin from his pocket and said it was a <q>good</q> coin.
                Next produced a balance scale and challenged the audience to suggest a plan for determining,
                in the fewest possible weighings,
                which of the four original coins was the counterfeit.
                He claimed you could do it in no more than two weighings.
                Describe how you would have to weigh the coins such that you would only have to only weigh the coins twice.
                <solution permid="ndf">
                  First, let's label each of the coins. The first four will be <m>A,B,C,D</m> while the good coin will be <m>G</m>. Let's first measure <m>A,B</m> against <m>C, G</m>. If the scale is balanced then we got lucky and <m>D</m> is the counterfeit coin. Next, weigh <m>D</m> against <m>G</m> to figure out if it is heavy or light. However, it may be the case that that <m>A+B > C+G</m> or <m>A+B < C+G</m>. If the first case is true then <m>D</m> is a good coin, and either <m>C</m> is light or <m>B</m> or <m>A</m> is heavy. Thus, a second weighting of <m>B</m> against <m>A</m> tells which coin is counterfeit. If <m>A=B</m> then <m>C</m> was the counterfeit and was lighter and if <m>A \not=B</m> then whichever one weighed more is the counterfeit and is heavier. Similarly for <m>A+B<C+G</m>. In this case, either <m>C</m> is heavy or <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is light. Weigh <m>A</m> against <m>B</m> and if they are equivalent then <m>C</m> is heavy. If not, then whichever one weighs less is the counterfeit and is lighter than the rest.

          Each step in our path adds 1 to either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.
          So to end at a point on <m>x+y = 5</m>,
          we must make <m>5</m> steps, each being in the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> direction.
          Thus all together there are <m>2^5</m> such paths.

          Answering this another way,
          notice that these paths end at <m>(0,5)</m>, <m>(1,4)</m>,
          <m>(2, 3)</m>, <m>(3,2)</m>, <m>(4,1)</m>, or <m>(5,0)</m>.
          Counting the paths to each of these points separately,

          This might remind you a little about the anagrams questions,

          how many <m>n</m> -letter words can you make using <m>k</m> a's, <m>j</m> b's and the rest of the letters c's?
          One answer is to pick <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> spots to fill with a's
          (in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways),
          then chose <m>j</m> of the remaining <m>n-k</m> spots to fill with b's, and fill the remaining spots with c's.
          Answer 2 is to first pick the spots where the b's go:
          pick <m>j</m> of the <m>n</m> spots to fill with b's, then pick <m>k</m> of the remaining <m>n-j</m> spots to fill with a's, and fill the remaining spots with c's.

          Another question you could ask:
          how many ways are there to select a <m>k</m> -person team and a <m>j</m> -person team from a group of <m>n</m> people.

                there are <m>{10 \choose 5}</m> ways to do this.
                Now how many ways are there to assign those outputs to the inputs <m>1</m> through 5?

                The stars are the 5 inputs and the bars are the 9 spots between the 10 possible outputs.
                Think of it this way - we will specify <m>f(1)</m>,
                then <m>f(2)</m>, then <m>f(3)</m>, and so on in that order.
                Start with the possible output 0.
                We can use it as the output of <m>f(1)</m>,
                or we can switch to 1 as a potential output.
                Say we put <m>f(1) = 1</m>.
                Now we are at 1
                (can't go back to 0).
                Should <m>f(2) = 1</m>?
                If yes, then we are putting down another star.
                If no, put down a bar and switch to 2.
                Maybe you switch to 3, then assign <m>f(2) = 3</m> and <m>f(3) = 3</m>
                (two more stars)
                before switching to 4 as a possible output.

          Everyone is right, under different interpretations.
          The 2520 number is correct if you assume that customers will pick 5 different items,
          but care about what order they eat them in
          (so eating a taco and then a burrito would be a different meal than eating a burrito then a taco).
          Then the answer would be <m>P(7,5) = 7\cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4</m>.
          If we care about the order we eat the items in but allow repeated items,
          we get <m>7^5 = 16807</m>.
          If we just want to count the number of 5-item meals,
          with 5 distinct items, we get <m>{7 \choose 5} = 21</m>.
          Another reasonable answer would be to count the number of 5-item meals,
          not distinguishing between different orders of consumption,
          but allowing for repeated items.
          This would be a stars-and-bars problem,
          giving <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> meals.

                  Now assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
                  That is, at the end of the <m>k</m> th day,
                  you have an odd number of beans.
                  What happens on the next day?
                  We triple the number of beans, and subtract 6.
                  If you triple an odd number, you will get an odd number.
                  Then subtracting 6
                  (an even number)
                  will still give you an odd number.
                  Thus the number of beans at the end of day <m>k+1</m> will be odd.
                  This concludes the inductive case.
                  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
                  <m>P(n)</m> is true of all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

                  The inductive case works independent of the base case.
                  We can prove the IF you have an odd number of beans on day <m>k</m>, THEN you have an odd number of beans on day <m>k+1</m>.
                  But to go from this to the conclusion that you will always have an odd number of beans requires a starting spot.
                  In fact, if you started with 4 beans,
                  then the next day you would have 6 beans, and then 12, and so on.
                  All these numbers would be even!

                  Hint: <m>(n+1)^{n+1} > (n+1) \cdot n^{n}</m>.
                  \begin{proof}
                  Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n! < n^n</m>.
                  We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
                  For the base case,
                  note that <m>2! = 2</m> while <m>2^2 = 4</m>, so <m>P(2)</m> is true.
                  For the inductive case,
                  assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 2</m>.
                  That is, <m>k! < k^k</m>.
                  Consider <m>(k+1)! = (k+1)k!</m>.
                  This is less than <m>(k+1)k^k</m> and <m>k^k</m> is less than <m>(k+1)^k</m>.
                  That is,
                  \begin{align*}
                  (k+1)! \amp = (k+1)k! \\
                  \amp < (k+1)k^k \\
                  \amp < (k+1)(k+1)^k \\
                  \amp = (k+1)^{k+1}
                  \end{align*}
                  Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
                  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.

                  We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
                  For the base case, we have
                  <m>\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} = \frac{1}{1+1}</m>, so <m>P(1)</m> is true.

                  For the inductive case,
                  assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
                  That is, <m>\d\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} +\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{k\cdot(k+1)} = \d\frac{k}{k+1}</m>.
                  Consider what happens when we add the next fraction,
                  namely <m>\frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)}</m> to both sides:

                  </me>
                  The right hand side becomes

                    \frac{k(k+2)}{(k+1)(k+2)} + \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{k+1}{k+2}
                  </me>
                  Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

                  Base case: <m>4^0 -1 = 0</m> which is a multiple of 3, so <m>P(0)</m> is true.

                  Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 0</m>.
                  That is, <m>4^k - 1</m> is a multiple of 3.
                  Consider <m>4^{k+1} - 1</m>.
                  We can write this as <m>4\cdot 4^k - 4 + 3</m>,
                  or equivalently <m>4(4^k - 1) + 3</m>.
                  Since <m>4^k-1</m> is a multiple of 3
                  (by the inductive hypothesis),
                  <m>4</m> times it is a multiple of 3, and adding 3 will still give a multiple of 3.

            We can then write <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 as follows:

            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
            <q>every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets.</q>
            We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            \underline{Base case}: Any set with 1 element <m>\{a\}</m> has exactly 2 subsets:
            the empty set and the set itself.
            Thus the number of subsets is <m>2= 2^1</m>.
            Thus <m>P(1)</m> is true.

            \underline{Inductive case}: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
            Thus every set containing exactly <m>k</m> elements has <m>2^k</m> different subsets.
            Now consider a set containing <m>k+1</m> elements:
            <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}</m>.
            Any subset of <m>A</m> must either contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> or not.
            In other words, a subset of <m>A</m> is just a subset of
            <m>\{a_1, a_2,\ldots,
            a_k\}</m> with or without <m>a_{k+1}</m>.
            Thus there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> and another <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which do not contain <m>a^{k+1}</m>.
            This gives a total of <m>2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m>.
            But our choice of <m>A</m> was arbitrary,
            so this works for any subset containing <m>k+1</m> elements,
            so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

            Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
            <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
