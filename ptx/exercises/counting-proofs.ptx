          Question: How many 2-letter words start with <em>a</em>,
          <em>b</em>,
          or <em>c</em> and end with either
          <em>y</em> or <em>z</em>?
        </p>

        <p permid="AxD">
          Answer 1: There are two words that start with <em>a</em>,
          two that start with <em>b</em>,
          two that start with <em>c</em>,
          for a total of <m>2+2+2</m>.

        <p permid="gEM">
          Answer 2: There are three choices for the first letter and two choices for the second letter,

        <p permid="MLV">
          Since the two answers are both answers to the same question,
