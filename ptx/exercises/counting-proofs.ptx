          Question: How many subsets of size <m>k</m> are there of the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>?
        </p>

        <p permid="kPg">
          Answer 1: You must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> elements to put in the set,
          which can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
        </p>

        <p permid="QWp">
          Answer 2: First count the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of
          <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> which contain the number <m>n</m>.
          We must choose <m>k-1</m> of the <m>n-1</m> other element to include in this set.
          Thus there are <m>{n-1\choose k-1}</m> such subsets.
          We have not yet counted all the <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> though.
          In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain <m>n</m>.
          To form one of these subsets,
          we need to choose <m>k</m> of the other <m>n-1</m> elements,
          so this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k}</m> ways.
          Thus the answer to the question is <m>{n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m>.

        </p>

        <p permid="hUA">
          Answer 1: We must choose 2 elements from <m>n+1</m> choices,
          so there are <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m> subsets.
        </p>

        <p permid="ObJ">
          Answer 2: We break this question down into cases,
          based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is.
          The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
        </p>

        <p permid="uiS">
          Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.

        <p permid="aqb">
          Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.

          When the larger element is <m>n+1</m>,
          there are <m>n</m> choices for the smaller element.
          Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases,
          the total number of two element subsets is <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.

          Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct answers to the same question,

        <p>
          <u>Answer 1</u>: You must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> elements to put in the set,
          which can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.

          n\}</m> which contain the number <m>n</m>.
          We must choose <m>k-1</m> of the <m>n-1</m> other element to include in this set.

          We have not yet counted all the <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> though.
          In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain <m>n</m>.
          To form one of these subsets,
          we need to choose <m>k</m> of the other <m>n-1</m> elements,
          so this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k}</m> ways.

        <p>
          <u>Answer 2</u>: We break this question down into cases,

          The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.

        <p>
          Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.

        There are 120 triangles.
        Here are a few ways
        (there are others as well)
        to get this:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              First count the triangles with the base on the <m>x</m> -axis.
              There are <m>{7 \choose 2}</m> ways to pick the base.
              The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
              (not the origin)
              so there are a total of <m>{7 \choose 2}4</m> of these triangles.
              The triangles with base on the <m>y</m> axis can be counted similarly:
              <m>{5 \choose 2}6</m>.
              However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the <m>x</m> -axis and also on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              There are <m>4 \cdot 6</m> right triangles.
              Thus the total number of triangles is:
              <me>
                {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              First count all the right triangles: <m>6 \cdot 4</m>.
              Then count all the non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis:
              <m>4 \cdot {6 \choose 2}</m>.
              Finally, the number of non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis:
              <m>6 \cdot {4 \choose 2}</m>.
              All together then we have <m>{6 \choose 2}4 + {4 \choose 2}6 + 6 \cdot 4 = 120</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Another approach to count the non-right triangles is to first select one of the two sides not parallel to an axis.
              This can be done in <m>6 \cdot 4</m> ways.
              Then for each of these, select one of the remaining 8 points,
              which determines the triangle.
              However, this double counts the non-right triangles,
              so we take <m>\frac{4\cdot 6 \cdot 8}{2}</m>,
              and then add on the <m>6\cdot 4</m> right triangles.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We must select 3 of the 11 dots.
              This can be done in <m>{11 \choose 3}</m> ways.
              However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the <m>x</m> -axis or on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              There are <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis.
              There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              Therefore the total number of triangles is
              <me>
                {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Picking two of these, we know the expressions must be equal
        (and not just because they are equal to 120).
        So we might write:
        <me>
          {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, suppose we have <m>m</m> dots on the <m>x</m> -axis
        (including the origin)
        and <m>n</m> dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
        (including the origin).
        Then counting the number of triangles in two different ways establishes:
        <me>
          {m+n \choose 3} - {m \choose 3} - {n \choose 3} = {m \choose 2}(n-1) + {n \choose 2}(m-1) - (m-1)(n-1)
        </me>

First, each digit can be one of three choices, so the total number of strings is <m>3^n</m>.  On the other hand, we could break the question down into cases by how many of the digits are 2's.  If they are all 2's, then there are <m>{n \choose 0}</m> strings.  If all but one is a 2, then there are <m>2{n \choose 1}</m> strings.  If all but 2 of the digits are 2's, then there are <m>2^2{n \choose 2}</m> strings.  We choose 2 of the <m>n</m> digits to be non-2, and then there are 2 choices for each of those digits.  And so on for every possible number of 2's in the string. Therefore <m> {n \choose 0} + 2{n \choose 1} + 2^2{n \choose 2} + 2^3{n \choose 3} + \cdots + 2^n{n \choose n} = 3^n. </m> </p> </li>

        How many ways are there to rearrange the letters in the word <q>rearrange</q>?
        Answer this question in at least two different ways to establish a binomial identity.
      </p>
    </statement>
    <!-- <solution>
      <p>
        The word contains 9 letters: 3 <q>r</q>s, 2 <q>a</q>s and 2 <q>e</q>s, along with an <q>n</q> and a <q>g</q>. We could first select the positions for the <q>r</q>s in <m>{9 \choose 3}</m> ways, then the <q>a</q>s in <m>{6 \choose 2}</m> ways, the <q>e</q>s in <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways and then select one of the remaining two spots to put the <q>n</q> (placing the <q>g</q> in the last spot). This gives the answer
        <me>
          {9 \choose 3}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}{2\choose 1}{1\choose 1}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        Alternatively, we could select the positions of the letters in the opposite order, which would give an answer
        <me>
          {9 \choose 1}{8\choose 1}{7 \choose 2}{5\choose 2}{3\choose 3}.
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        (where the 3 <q>r</q>s go in the remaining 3 spots). These two expressions are equal:
        <me>
          {9 \choose 3}{6 \choose 2}{4 \choose 2}{2\choose 1}{1\choose 1} = {9 \choose 1}{8\choose 1}{7 \choose 2}{5\choose 2}{3\choose 3}.

        Give a combinatorial proof for the identity <m>P(n,k) = {n \choose k}k!</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution>

      <proof>
        <p>
          <u>Question</u>: How many <m>k</m>-letter words can you make using <m>n</m> different letters without repeating any letter?
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Answer 1</u>: There are <m>n</m> choices for the first letter,
          <m>n-1</m> choices for the second letter,
          <m>n-2</m> choices for the third letter,
          and so on until <m>n - (k-1)</m> choices for the <m>k</m>th letter
          (since <m>k-1</m> letters have already been assigned at that point).
          The product of these numbers can be written
          <m>\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}</m> which is <m>P(n,k)</m>.
          Therefore there are <m>P(n,k)</m> words.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Answer 2</u>: First pick <m>k</m> letters to be in the word from the <m>n</m> choices.
          This can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
          Now arrange those letters into a word.
          There are <m>k</m> choices for the first letter,
          <m>k-1</m> choices for the second, and so on,
          for a total of <m>k!</m> arrangements of the <m>k</m> letters.
          Thus the total number of words is <m>{n \choose k}k!</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the two answers are correct answers to the same question,
          we have established that <m>P(n,k) = {n \choose k}k!</m>.

        Establish the identity below using a combinatorial proof.

        <p>
          <u>Question</u>: How many 5-element subsets are there of the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n+3\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Answer 1</u>: We choose 5 out of the <m>n+3</m> elements,
          so <m>{n+3 \choose 5}</m> subsets.
        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Answer 2</u>: Break this up into cases by what the <q>middle</q>
          (third smallest)
          element of the 5 element subset is.
          The smallest this could be is a 3.
          In that case,
          we have <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers below it,
          and <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the numbers above it.
          Alternatively, the middle number could be a 4.
          In this case there are <m>{3 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and
          <m>{n-1 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers.
          If the middle number is 5, then there are
          <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and
          <m>{n-2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top two numbers.
          An so on, all the way up to the largest the middle number could be,
          which is <m>n+1</m>.
          In that case there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> choices for the bottom two numbers and
          <m>{2 \choose 2}</m> choices for the top number.
          Thus the number of 5 element subsets is
          <me>
            {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2}
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since the two answers correctly answer the same question, we have
          <me>
            {2 \choose 2}{n \choose 2} + {3 \choose 2}{n-1 \choose 2} + {4\choose 2}{n-2 \choose 2} + \cdots + {n\choose 2}{2\choose 2} = {n+3 \choose 5}
          </me>.
