          Question: How many subsets of size <m>k</m> are there of the set <m>\{1,2,\ldots, n\}</m>?
        </p>

        <p permid="kPg">
          Answer 1: You must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> elements to put in the set,
          which can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
        </p>

        <p permid="QWp">
          Answer 2: First count the number of <m>k</m>-element subsets of
          <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> which contain the number <m>n</m>.
          We must choose <m>k-1</m> of the <m>n-1</m> other element to include in this set.
          Thus there are <m>{n-1\choose k-1}</m> such subsets.
          We have not yet counted all the <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> though.
          In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain <m>n</m>.
          To form one of these subsets,
          we need to choose <m>k</m> of the other <m>n-1</m> elements,
          so this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k}</m> ways.
          Thus the answer to the question is <m>{n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m>.

        </p>

        <p permid="hUA">
          Answer 1: We must choose 2 elements from <m>n+1</m> choices,
          so there are <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m> subsets.
        </p>

        <p permid="ObJ">
          Answer 2: We break this question down into cases,
          based on what the larger of the two elements in the subset is.
          The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.
        </p>

        <p permid="uiS">
          Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.

        <p permid="aqb">
          Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.

          When the larger element is <m>n+1</m>,
          there are <m>n</m> choices for the smaller element.
          Since each two element subset must be in exactly one of these cases,
          the total number of two element subsets is <m>1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + n</m>.

        <p permid="SLC">
          Answer 1 and answer 2 are both correct answers to the same question,

        <p>
          <u>Answer 1</u>: You must choose <m>k</m> out of <m>n</m> elements to put in the set,
          which can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
        </p>

        <p>

          n\}</m> which contain the number <m>n</m>.
          We must choose <m>k-1</m> of the <m>n-1</m> other element to include in this set.

          We have not yet counted all the <m>k</m>-element subsets of <m>\{1,2,\ldots,
          n\}</m> though.
          In fact, we have missed exactly those subsets which do NOT contain <m>n</m>.
          To form one of these subsets,
          we need to choose <m>k</m> of the other <m>n-1</m> elements,
          so this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k}</m> ways.
          Thus the answer to the question is <m>{n-1 \choose k-1} + {n-1 \choose k}</m>.

        </p>

        <p>
          <u>Answer 2</u>: We break this question down into cases,

          The larger element can't be 1, since we need at least one element smaller than it.

        <p>
          Larger element is 2: there is 1 choice for the smaller element.

          Larger element is 3: there are 2 choices for the smaller element.

              The third vertex of the triangle must be one of the 4 dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
              (not the origin)
              so there are a total of <m>{7 \choose 2}4</m> of these triangles.
              The triangles with base on the <m>y</m> axis can be counted similarly:
              <m>{5 \choose 2}6</m>.
              However, we have counted all the right triangles twice - they have a base on the <m>x</m> -axis and also on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              There are <m>4 \cdot 6</m> right triangles.
              Thus the total number of triangles is:
              <me>
                {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4 = 120
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              First count all the right triangles: <m>6 \cdot 4</m>.
              Then count all the non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis:
              <m>4 \cdot {6 \choose 2}</m>.
              Finally, the number of non-right triangles with two vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis:
              <m>6 \cdot {4 \choose 2}</m>.
              All together then we have <m>{6 \choose 2}4 + {4 \choose 2}6 + 6 \cdot 4 = 120</m>.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Another approach to count the non-right triangles is to first select one of the two sides not parallel to an axis.
              This can be done in <m>6 \cdot 4</m> ways.
              Then for each of these, select one of the remaining 8 points,
              which determines the triangle.
              However, this double counts the non-right triangles,
              so we take <m>\frac{4\cdot 6 \cdot 8}{2}</m>,
              and then add on the <m>6\cdot 4</m> right triangles.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              We must select 3 of the 11 dots.
              This can be done in <m>{11 \choose 3}</m> ways.
              However, this will also give us degenerate triangles when all three vertices are on the <m>x</m> -axis or on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              There are <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>x</m> -axis.
              There are <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> ways we could have picked all three vertices on the <m>y</m> -axis.
              Therefore the total number of triangles is
              <me>
                {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = 120
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <p>
        Picking two of these, we know the expressions must be equal
        (and not just because they are equal to 120).
        So we might write:
        <me>
          {11 \choose 3} - {7 \choose 3} - {5 \choose 3} = {7 \choose 2}4 + {5 \choose 2}6 - 6\cdot 4
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        In general, suppose we have <m>m</m> dots on the <m>x</m> -axis
        (including the origin)
        and <m>n</m> dots on the <m>y</m> -axis
        (including the origin).
        Then counting the number of triangles in two different ways establishes:
        <me>
          {m+n \choose 3} - {m \choose 3} - {n \choose 3} = {m \choose 2}(n-1) + {n \choose 2}(m-1) - (m-1)(n-1)
        </me>

          Question: How many ways can you select a chaired committee of <m>k</m> people from a group of <m>n</m> people?
          That is, you need to select <m>k</m> people to be on the committee and one of them needs to be in charge.
          How many ways can this happen?
        </p>

        <p>
          Answer 1: First select <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> people to be on the committee.
          This can be done in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
          Now select one of those <m>k</m> people to be in charge - this can be done in <m>k</m> ways.
          So there are a total of <m>k {n \choose k}</m> ways to select the chaired committee.
        </p>

        <p>
          Answer 2: First select the chair of the committee.
          You have <m>n</m> people to choose from,
          so this can be done in <m>n</m> ways.
          Now fill the rest of the committee.
          There are <m>n-1</m> people to choose from
          (you cannot select the person you picked to be the chair)
          and <m>k-1</m> spots to fill
          (the chair's spot is already taken).
          So this can be done in <m>{n-1 \choose k-1}</m> ways.
          Therefore there are <m>n{n-1 \choose k-1}</m> ways to select the chaired committee.
