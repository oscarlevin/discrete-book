      A <term>function</term>
      is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.
      We call the output the <term>image</term> of the input.
      The set of all inputs for a function is called the <term>domain</term>.
      The set of all allowable outputs is called the
      <term>codomain</term>.
      We would write <m>f:X \to Y</m> to describe a function with name <m>f</m>,
      domain <m>X</m> and codomain <m>Y</m>.
      This does not tell us <em>which</em>
      function <m>f</m> is though.
      To define the function, we must describe the rule.
      This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input
      (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule).
    </p>

    <p permid="YRj">
      For example, consider the function
      <m>f:\N \to \N</m> defined by <m>f(x) = x^2 + 3</m>.
      Here the domain and codomain are the same set
      (the natural numbers).
      The rule is: take your input,
      multiply it by itself and add 3.
      This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number
      (every element of the domain)
      and the result is always a natural number
      (an element of the codomain).
      Notice though that not every natural number is actually an output
      (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.).
      The set of natural numbers that
      <em>are</em> outputs is called the
      <term>range</term>
          <idx><h>range of a function</h></idx>
      of the function
      (in this case,
      the range is <m>\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}</m>,
      all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).
    </p>

    <p permid="EYs">
      The key thing that makes a rule a <em>function</em>
      is that there is <em>exactly one</em> output for each input.
      That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule.
      What output do we assign to the input 7?
      There can only be one answer for any particular function.

    <title>Describing Functions</title>
    <idx><h>function</h><h>how to describe</h></idx>
    <p permid="JIl">
      It is worth making a distinction between a function and its description.
      The function is the abstract mathematical object that in some way exists whether or not anyone ever talks about it.
      But when we <em>do</em> want to talk about the function,
      we need a way to describe it.
      A particular function can be described in multiple ways.
    </p>

    <p permid="pPu">
      <idx><h sortby="rule of four"><em>rule of four</em></h></idx>
      Some calculus textbooks talk about the <em>Rule of Four</em>,
      that every function can be described in four ways:
      algebraically (a formula), numerically (a table), graphically,
      or in words.
      In discrete math,
      we can still use any of these to describe functions,
      but we can also be more specific since we are primarily concerned with functions that have <m>\N</m> or a finite subset of <m>\N</m> as their domain.
    </p>

    <p permid="VWD">
      <idx><h>graph (of a function)</h></idx>
      Describing a function graphically usually means drawing the graph of the function:
      plotting the points on the plane.
      We can do this,
      and might get a graph like the following for a function <m>f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}</m>.
    </p>

      It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve.
      There are only three elements in the domain.
      A curve would mean that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers.

      This shows that the function <m>f</m> sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3:
      just follow the arrows.
    </p>

    <p permid="uzn">
      The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions.
      We will often be working with functions with
      <em>finite</em> domains,
      so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function.
    </p>

    <p permid="aGw">
      Note that for finite domains,
      finding an algebraic formula that gives the output for any input is often impossible.
      Of course we could use a piecewise defined function, like
      <me permid="RWE">
        f(x) = \begin{cases} x+1 \amp \text{ if } x = 1 \\ x-1 \amp \text{ if } x = 2 \\ x \amp \text{ if } x = 3\end{cases}
      </me>.
      This describes exactly the same function as above,
      but we can all agree is a ridiculous way of doing so.
    </p>

    <p permid="GNF">
      Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains,
      let's adopt some notation to describe them.
      All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain.
      In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:

      We simplify this further by writing this as a <q>matrix</q> with each input directly over its output:
      <me permid="ydN">
        f = \twoline{0 \amp 1 \amp 2\amp 3 \amp 4}{3 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 1}

      Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class
      (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices,
      or row reduce them, for example).

    <p permid="TbX">
      One advantage of the two-line notation over the arrow diagrams is that it is harder to accidentally define a rule that is not a function using two-line notation.

          It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for <m>h</m>.
          We would have something like:

            h=\twoline{1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4}{\amp a,c? \amp d \amp b}

      Here two-line notation is no good,

      For example, consider the function

      Recursively defined functions are often easier to create from a

    <title>Image and Inverse Image</title>

    <p permid="hfC">
      When discussing functions,
      we have notation for talking about an element of the domain
      (say <m>x</m>)
      and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write <m>f(x)</m>,
      which <em>is</em> the image of <m>x</m>).
      Sometimes we will want to talk about all the elements that are images of some subset of the domain.
      It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain
      (say <m>y</m>)
      and talk about which element or elements
      (if any)
      from the domain it is the image of.
      We could write <q>those <m>x</m> in the domain such that <m>f(x) = y</m>,</q>
      but this is a lot of writing.
      Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
    </p>

    <p permid="NmL">
      <idx><h>image</h><h>of a set</h></idx>
      To address the first situation,
      what we are after is a way to describe the <em>set</em>
      of images of elements in some subset of the domain.
      Suppose <m>f:X \to Y</m> is a function and that
      <m>A \subseteq X</m> is some subset of the domain
      (possibly all of it).
      We will use the notation <m>f(A)</m> to denote the
      <term>image of <m>A</m> under <m>f</m></term>,
      namely the set of elements in <m>Y</m> that are the image of elements from <m>A</m>.
      That is, <m>f(A) = \{f(a) \in Y \st a \in A\}</m>.

      <notation>
        <usage>f(A)</usage>
        <description>the image of <m>A</m> under <m>f</m>.</description>
      </notation>
    </p>

    <p permid="ttU">
    <idx><h>inverse image</h></idx>
    <idx><h>complete inverse image</h></idx>
      We can do this in the other direction as well.
      We might ask which elements of the domain get mapped to a particular set in the codomain.
      Let <m>f:X \to Y</m> be a function and suppose
      <m>B \subseteq Y</m> is a subset of the codomain.
      Then we will write <m>f\inv(B)</m> for the
      <term>inverse image of <m>B</m> under <m>f</m></term>,
      namely the set of elements in <m>X</m> whose image are elements in <m>B</m>.
      In other words, <m>f\inv(B) = \{x \in X \st f(x) \in B\}</m>.

      <notation>
        <usage>f\inv(B)</usage>
        <description>the inverse image of <m>B</m> under <m>f</m>.</description>
      </notation>

    </p>

    <p permid="ZBd">
      Often we are interested in the element(s) whose image is a particular element <m>y</m> of in the codomain.
      The notation above works:
      <m>f\inv(\{y\})</m> is the set of all elements in the domain that <m>f</m> sends to <m>y</m>.
      It makes sense to think of this as a set:
      there might not be anything sent to <m>y</m>
      (if <m>y</m> is not in the range),
      in which case <m>f\inv(\{y\}) = \emptyset</m>.
      Or <m>f</m> might send multiple elements to <m>y</m>
      (if <m>f</m> is not injective).
      As a notational convenience,
      we usually drop the set braces around the <m>y</m> and write
      <m>f\inv(y)</m> instead for this set.
    </p>

    <p permid="FIm">
      <idx><h>inverse image</h><h>comparison to inverse function</h></idx>
      WARNING: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is not an inverse function!
      Inverse functions only exist for bijections,
      but <m>f\inv(y)</m> is defined for any function <m>f</m>.
      The point: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is a <em>set</em>,
      not an <em>element</em> of the domain.
      This is just sloppy notation for <m>f\inv(\{y\})</m>.
      To help make this distinction,
      we would call <m>f\inv(y)</m> the
      <term>complete inverse image of <m>y</m> under <m>f</m></term>.
      It is not the image of <m>y</m> under <m>f\inv</m>
