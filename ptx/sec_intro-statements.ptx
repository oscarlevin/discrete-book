        While walking through a fictional forest,
        you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge.
        Each is either a <em>knight</em>,
        who always tells the truth, or a
        <em>knave</em>, who always lies.
        The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave.
        Each troll makes a single statement:
      </p>

      <blockquote permid="RmX">
        <p permid="vxP">
          Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.
        </p>

        <p permid="bEY">
          Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
        </p>

        <p permid="HMh">
          Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.

      In order to <em>do</em> mathematics,
      we must be able to <em>talk</em> and
      <em>write</em> about mathematics.
      Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems.
      As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics,
      writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.

      Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects,
      and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks:

      A <term>statement</term>
      is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
      A statement is
      <term>atomic</term> if it cannot be divided into smaller statements,

      <idx><h>sentence (compared to statement)</h></idx>
      The reason the sentence <q><m>3 + x = 12</m></q>
      is not a statement is that it contains a variable.
      Depending on what
      <m>x</m> is, the sentence is either true or false,
      but right now it is neither.
      One way to make the <em>sentence</em>
      into a <em>statement</em>
      is to specify the value of the variable in some way.
      This could be done by specifying a specific substitution,
      for example,
      <q><m>3+x = 12</m> where <m>x = 9</m>,</q>
      which is a true statement.
      Or you could <em>capture</em> the free variable by
      <em>quantifying</em> over it, as in,
      <q>for all values of <m>x</m>,
      <m>3+x = 12</m>,</q> which is false.
      We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.

      <idx><h>logical connectives</h></idx>

      You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler
      (atomic or molecular)
      ones using
      <term>logical connectives</term>.
      For example, this is a molecular statement:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="JIy">
      <p permid="nTq">
        Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="FBv">
      <idx><h>binary connective</h></idx>
      <idx><h>unary connective</h></idx>
      Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements.
      The two shorter statements are
      <em>connected</em> by an
      <q>and.</q> We will consider 5 connectives:
      <q>and</q> (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman),
      <q>or</q> (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman),
      <q>if<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/></q>
      (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman),
      <q>if and only if</q> (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and
      <q>not</q> (Sam is not a man).
      The first four are called
      <term>binary connectives</term>
      (because they connect two statements)
      while
      <q>not</q> is an example of a
      <term>unary connective</term>
      (since it applies to a single statement).
    </p>

      <idx><h>Boolean variable</h><see>propositional variable</see></idx>

      These molecular statements are of course still statements,
      so they must be either true or false.
      The absolutely key observation here is that which <term>truth value</term> 
      the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts.
      We do not need to know what the parts actually say,
      only whether those parts are true or false.
      So to analyze logical connectives,
      it is enough to consider <term>propositional variables</term>
      (sometimes called <em>sentential</em> variables),
      usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet:
      <m>P, Q, R, S, \ldots</m>.
      We think of these as standing in for
      (usually atomic)
      statements, but there are only two <em>values</em>
      the variables can achieve: true or false.<fn>
      In computer programing, we should call such variables
      <term>Boolean variables</term>.

      We also have symbols for the logical connectives:

      <m>\imp</m>,
      <m>\iff</m>,
      <m>\neg</m>.

      The biconditional
      (if and only if)
      might seem a little strange,
      but you should think of this as saying the two parts of the statements are <em>equivalent</em>

      <m>P \imp Q</m> which has a slightly different meaning in mathematics than it does in ordinary usage.

      they deserve their own subsection.

      <idx><h>Pythagorean theorem</h></idx>
      Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication.
      Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart.
      Consider the <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em>.
      Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as
      <q><m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      This is absolutely not correct.
      For one thing,
      that is not a statement since it has three variables in it.
      Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables?
      So <m>1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2</m>??? How can we fix this?
      Well, the equation is true as long as <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs or a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the hypotenuse.
      In other words:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="pPH">
      <p permid="Uaz">
        <em>If</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>,
        <em>then </em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="Klo">
      This is a reasonable way to think about implications:
      our claim is that the conclusion (<q>then</q> part) is true,
      but on the assumption that the hypothesis (<q>if</q> part) is true.
      We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.<fn>
      However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem,
      it is also the case that <em>if</em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>,
      <em>then</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>.
      So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional:
      <q><m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m> <em>if and only if</em>
      <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      </fn></p>

    <p permid="qsx">
      Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement,
      and therefore is either true or false.
      The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts.
      To agree with the usage above,
      we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false,
      or when the conclusion is true.
      This leaves only one way for an implication to be false:
      when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.

          Suppose I made that statement to Bob.

          What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final,
          and he did pass the class?
          Then I have not lied; my statement is true.
          However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class,
          then I lied, making the statement false.
          The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final?
          Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't.
          Did I lie in either case?
          I think not.

      It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true,

      but all we are really doing is explaining
      (very carefully)
      why a statement is true.

      However, sometimes the converse of a true statement is also true.
      For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse:

      <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> is a <em>right</em> triangle.

      The contrapositive, on the other hand,

          then you don't have nine cards.
          It is easy to see why this is true:
          you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits,

      It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences.
      For example,
      suppose we wanted to claim that if <m>n</m> is prime,
      then <m>n+7</m> is not prime.
      This looks like an implication.
      I would like to write something like
      <me permid="tWX">
        P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
      </me>
      where <m>P(n)</m> means <q> <m>n</m> is prime.</q>
      But this is not quite right.
      For one thing, because this sentence has a
      <term>free variable</term>
      (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about),
      it is not a statement.  A sentence that contains variables is called a <term>predicate</term>.
    </p>
    <p permid="cYM">
      Now, if we plug in a specific value for <m>n</m>, we do get a statement.
      In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for <m>n</m>,
      we get a true implication in this case.
      What we really want to say is that
      <em>for all</em> values of <m>n</m>,
      if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n+7</m> is not.
      We need to <em>quantify</em> the variable.

    <p permid="JfV">
      Although there are many types of
      <em>quantifiers</em> in English (e.g., many, few, most,
      etc.) in mathematics we, for the most part, stick to two:
      existential and universal.

      As with all mathematical statements,
      we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false.
      Consider the statement
      <me permid="msy">
        \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
      </me>.
      You would read this,
      <q>for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> such that <m>y</m> is less than <m>x</m>.</q> Is this true?
      The answer depends on what our <em>domain of discourse</em> is:
      when we say <q>for all</q> <m>x</m>,
      do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set?
      Usually this information is implied.
      In discrete mathematics,
      we almost always quantify over the
      <em>natural numbers</em>, 0, 1, 2,
      <ellipsis/>, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.
    </p>

    <p permid="Vun">
      For the statement to be true,
      we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select,
      there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller.
      Perhaps we could let
      <m>y</m> be
      <m>x-1</m>?
      But here is the problem: what if
      <m>x = 0</m>?
      Then
      <m>y = -1</m> and that is
      <em>not a number!</em>
      (in our domain of discourse).
      Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers.
      In symbols,
      <me permid="SzH">
        \exists x \forall y (y \ge x)
      </me>.

    <p permid="BBw">
      To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the
      <em>negation</em> was true.
      Notice how the negation and original statement compare.
      This is typical.

      Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier,

      It is always a good idea to be precise in mathematics.  Sometimes though, we can relax a little bit, as long as we all agree on a convention.  An example of such a convention is to assume that sentences containing predicates with free variables are intended as statements, where the variables are universally quantified. 
    </p>
    
    <p permid="rxQ">
      For example, do you believe that if a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle?  But how can that be true if it is not a statement?  To be a little more precise, we have two predicates: <m>S(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a square</q> and <m>R(x)</m> standing for <q><m>x</m> is a rectangle</q>.  The <em>sentence</em> we are looking at is,
      
      <me permid="yGQ">
        S(x) \imp R(x)
      </me>.
      This is neither true nor false, as it is not a statement.  But come on!  We all know that we meant to consider the statement,
      
      <me permid="eNZ">
        \forall x (S(x) \imp R(x))
      </me>,
      
      and this is what our convention tells us to consider.
    </p>
    
    <p permid="XEZ">
      Similarly, we will often be a bit sloppy about the distinction between a predicate and a statement.  For example, we might write, <em>let <m>P(n)</m> be the <em>statement</em>, <q><m>n</m> is prime,</q></em> which is technically incorrect.  It is implicit that we mean that we are defining <m>P(n)</m> to be a predicate, which for each <m>n</m> becomes the statement, <m>n</m> is prime.

            Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which.  Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.

            This statement is true.  The hypothesis of the statement is false (10 is not prime), so the implication is automatically true.

        <statement>

            It turns out that 8 is solitary.  Does this tell you anything about the truth or falsity of the original statement, its converse or its contrapositive?  Explain.

        <solution>
          <p>
            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em> <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em> <m>S</m> of solitary numbers.  Explain.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.  Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
