        While walking through a fictional forest,
        you encounter three trolls guarding a bridge.
        Each is either a <em>knight</em>,
        who always tells the truth, or a
        <em>knave</em>, who always lies.
        The trolls will not let you pass until you correctly identify each as either a knight or a knave.
        Each troll makes a single statement:
      </p>

      <blockquote permid="Scv">
        <p permid="jYV">
          Troll 1: If I am a knave, then there are exactly two knights here.
        </p>

        <p permid="Qge">
          Troll 2: Troll 1 is lying.
        </p>

        <p permid="wnn">
          Troll 3: Either we are all knaves or at least one of us is a knight.

      In order to <em>do</em> mathematics,
      we must be able to <em>talk</em> and
      <em>write</em> about mathematics.
      Perhaps your experience with mathematics so far has mostly involved finding answers to problems.
      As we embark towards more advanced and abstract mathematics,
      writing will play a more prominent role in the mathematical process.

      Communication in mathematics requires more precision than many other subjects,
      and thus we should take a few pages here to consider the basic building blocks:

      A <term>statement</term><idx>
      <h>statement</h>
      </idx> is any declarative sentence which is either true or false.
      A statement is

    </example>

    <p permid="fYW">
      The reason the sentence <q><m>3 + x = 12</m></q>
      is not a statement is that it contains a variable.
      Depending on what
      <m>x</m> is, the sentence is either true or false,
      but right now it is neither.
      One way to make the <em>sentence</em>
      into a <em>statement</em>
      is to specify the value of the variable in some way.
      This could be done by specifying a specific substitution,
      for example,
      <q><m>3+x = 12</m> where <m>x = 9</m>,</q>
      which is a true statement.
      Or you could <em>capture</em> the free variable by
      <em>quantifying</em> over it, as in,
      <q>for all values of <m>x</m>,
      <m>3+x = 12</m>,</q> which is false.
      We will discuss quantifiers in more detail at the end of this section.
    </p>

    <p permid="Mgf">
      You can build more complicated (molecular) statements out of simpler
      (atomic or molecular)
      ones using
      <term>logical connectives</term>
      .
          <idx><h>connectives</h></idx>
      For example, this is a molecular statement:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="yjE">
      <p permid="cuw">
        Telephone numbers in the USA have 10 digits and 42 is a perfect square.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="sno">
      Note that we can break this down into two smaller statements.
      The two shorter statements are
      <em>connected</em> by an
      <q>and.</q> We will consider 5 connectives:
      <q>and</q> (Sam is a man and Chris is a woman),
      <q>or</q> (Sam is a man or Chris is a woman),
      <q>if<ellipsis/>, then<ellipsis/></q>
      (if Sam is a man, then Chris is a woman),
      <q>if and only if</q> (Sam is a man if and only if Chris is a woman), and
      <q>not</q> (Sam is not a man).
      The first four are called
      <term>binary connectives</term>
      (because they connect two statements)
      while
      <q>not</q> is an example of a
      <term>unary connective</term>
      (since it applies to a single statement).
    </p>

    <p permid="Yux">
      These molecular statements are of course still statements,
      so they must be either true or false.
      The absolutely key observation here is that which <term>truth value</term> 
          <idx><h>truth value</h></idx>
      the molecular statement achieves is completely determined by the type of connective and the truth values of the parts.
      We do not need to know what the parts actually say,
      only whether those parts are true or false.
      So to analyze logical connectives,
      it is enough to consider <term>propositional variables</term>
      (sometimes called <em>sentential</em> variables),
      usually capital letters in the middle of the alphabet:
      <m>P, Q, R, S, \ldots</m>.
      We think of these as standing in for
      (usually atomic)
      statements, but there are only two <em>values</em>
      the variables can achieve: true or false.<fn>
      In computer programing, we should call such variables
      <term>Boolean variables</term>.

        <usage>P, Q, R, S, \ldots</usage>
        <description>propositional (sentential) variables</description>

      We also have symbols for the logical connectives:
      <m>\wedge</m>,
      <m>\vee</m>,
      <m>\imp</m>,
      <m>\iff</m>,
      <m>\neg</m>.

        An implication is <em>true</em>

        In particular, the only way for

      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p permid="psI">
      Easily the most common type of statement in mathematics is the implication.
      Even statements that do not at first look like they have this form conceal an implication at their heart.
      Consider the <em>Pythagorean Theorem</em>.
      Many a college freshman would quote this theorem as
      <q><m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      This is absolutely not correct.
      For one thing,
      that is not a statement since it has three variables in it.
      Perhaps they imply that this should be true for any values of the variables?
      So <m>1^2 + 5^2 = 2^2</m>??? How can we fix this?
      Well, the equation is true as long as <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs or a right triangle and <m>c</m> is the hypotenuse.
      In other words:
    </p>

    <blockquote permid="eqN">
      <p permid="IBF">
        <em>If</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>,
        <em>then </em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p permid="VzR">
      This is a reasonable way to think about implications:
      our claim is that the conclusion (<q>then</q> part) is true,
      but on the assumption that the hypothesis (<q>if</q> part) is true.
      We make no claim about the conclusion in situations when the hypothesis is false.<fn>
      However, note that in the case of the Pythagorean Theorem,
      it is also the case that <em>if</em> <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>,
      <em>then</em> <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m>.
      So we could have also expressed this theorem as a biconditional:
      <q><m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are the legs of a right triangle with hypotenuse <m>c</m> <em>if and only if</em>
      <m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>.</q>
      </fn></p>

    <p permid="BHa">
      Still, it is important to remember that an implication is a statement,
      and therefore is either true or false.
      The truth value of the implication is determined by the truth values of its two parts.
      To agree with the usage above,
      we say that an implication is true either when the hypothesis is false,
      or when the conclusion is true.
      This leaves only one way for an implication to be false:
      when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false.
    </p>

    <example permid="fwg">
      <statement>
        <p permid="tsH">
          Consider the statement:
        </p>

        <blockquote permid="UXb">
          <p permid="oIO">
            If Bob gets a 90 on the final,
            then Bob will pass the class.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p permid="ZzQ">
          This is definitely an implication:
          <m>P</m> is the statement <q>Bob gets a 90 on the final,</q>
          and <m>Q</m> is the statement <q>Bob will pass the class.</q>
        </p>

        <p permid="FGZ">
          Suppose I made that statement to Bob.
          In what circumstances would it be fair to call me a liar?
          What if Bob really did get a 90 on the final,
          and he did pass the class?
          Then I have not lied; my statement is true.
          However, if Bob did get a 90 on the final and did not pass the class,
          then I lied, making the statement false.
          The tricky case is this: what if Bob did not get a 90 on the final?
          Maybe he passes the class, maybe he doesn't.
          Did I lie in either case?
          I think not.
          In these last two cases,
          <m>P</m> was false, and the statement <m>P \imp Q</m> was true.
          In the first case, <m>Q</m> was true,
          and so was <m>P \imp Q</m>.
          So <m>P \imp Q</m> is true when either <m>P</m> is false or <m>Q</m> is true.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p permid="hOj">
      Just to be clear,
      although we sometimes read <m>P \imp Q</m> as <q> <m>P</m>
      <em>implies</em> <m>Q</m> </q>,
      we are not insisting that there is some causal relationship between the statements <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m>.
      In particular,
      if you claim that <m>P \imp Q</m> is <em>false</em>,
      you are not saying that <m>P</m> does not imply <m>Q</m>,
      but rather that <m>P</m> is true and <m>Q</m> is false.

      but all we are really doing is explaining
      (very carefully)
      why a statement is true.

      Mathematics is overflowing with examples of true implications which have a false converse.
      If a number greater than 2 is prime, then that number is odd.
      However, just because a number is odd does not mean it is prime.
      If a shape is a square, then it is a rectangle.
      But it is false that if a shape is a rectangle, then it is a square.
      While this happens often, it does not always happen.
      For example, the Pythagorean theorem has a true converse:
      if<m>a^2 + b^2 = c^2</m>, then the triangle with sides <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>, and <m>c</m> is a <em>right</em> triangle.
      Whenever you encounter an implication in mathematics,
      it is always reasonable to ask whether the converse is true.
    </p>

    <p permid="LaM">
      The contrapositive, on the other hand,
      always has the same truth value as its original implication.
      This can be very helpful in deciding whether an implication is true:
      often it is easier to analyze the contrapositive.

          The original implication is a little hard to analyze because there are so many different combinations of nine cards.
          But consider the contrapositive: If you <em>don't</em>
          have at least three cards all of the same suit,
          then you don't have nine cards.
          It is easy to see why this is true:
          you can at most have two cards of each of the four suits,
          for a total of eight cards
          (or fewer).

          The converse: If you have at least three cards all of the same suit,

          Note that to demonstrate that the converse
          (an implication)
          is false, we provided an example where the hypothesis is true
          (you do have three cards of the same suit),

      It would be nice to use variables in our mathematical sentences.
      For example,
      suppose we wanted to claim that if <m>n</m> is prime,
      then <m>n+7</m> is not prime.
      This looks like an implication.
      I would like to write something like
      <me permid="qcC">
        P(n) \imp \neg P(n+7)
      </me>
      where <m>P(n)</m> means <q> <m>n</m> is prime.</q>
      But this is not quite right.
      For one thing, because this sentence has a
      <term>free variable</term>
      (that is, a variable that we have not specified anything about),
      it is not a statement.
      Now, if we plug in a specific value for <m>n</m>, we do get a statement.
      In fact, it turns out that no matter what value we plug in for <m>n</m>,
      we get a true implication.
      What we really want to say is that
      <em>for all</em> values of <m>n</m>,
      if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n+7</m> is not.
      We need to <em>quantify</em> the variable.

      Although there are many types of
      <em>quantifiers</em> in English (e.g., many, few, most,

    <p permid="lsJ">
      As with all mathematical statements,
      we would like to decide whether quantified statements are true or false.
      Consider the statement
      <me permid="iyd">
        \forall x \exists y (y \lt x)
      </me>.
      You would read this,
      <q>for every <m>x</m> there is some <m>y</m> such that <m>y</m> is less than <m>x</m>.</q> Is this true?
      The answer depends on what our <em>domain of discourse</em> is:
      when we say <q>for all</q> <m>x</m>,
      do we mean all positive integers or all real numbers or all elements of some other set?
      Usually this information is implied.
      In discrete mathematics,
      we almost always quantify over the
      <em>natural numbers</em>, 0, 1, 2,
      <ellipsis/>, so let's take that for our domain of discourse here.
    </p>

    <p permid="RzS">
      For the statement to be true,
      we need it to be the case that no matter what natural number we select,
      there is always some natural number that is strictly smaller.
      Perhaps we could let
      <m>y</m> be
      <m>x-1</m>?
      But here is the problem: what if
      <m>x = 0</m>?
      Then
      <m>y = -1</m> and that is
      <em>not a number!</em>
      (in our domain of discourse).
      Thus we see that the statement is false because there is a number which is less than or equal to all other numbers.
      In symbols,
      <me permid="OFm">
        \exists x \forall y (y \ge x)
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="xHb">
      To show that the original statement is false, we proved that the
      <em>negation</em> was true.
      Notice how the negation and original statement compare.
      This is typical.

      Essentially, we can pass the negation symbol over a quantifier,

      This should not be surprising:

      then something doesn't have that property.
      And if there is not something with a property,

        <p>
          Consider the statement, <q>For all natural numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is prime, then <m>n</m> is solitary.</q>  You do not need to know what <em>solitary</em> means for this problem, just that it is a property that some numbers have and others do not.

          <p>
            Write the converse and the contrapositive of the statement, saying which is which.  Note: the original statement claims that an implication is true for all <m>n</m>, and it is that implication that we are taking the converse and contrapositive of.

          <p>
            The converse: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is solitary, then <m>n</m> is prime.  The contrapositive: For all numbers <m>n</m>, if <m>n</m> is not solitary, then <m>n</m> is not prime.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The negation: There is a natural number <m>n</m> which is prime <em>and</em> not solitary.  So to prove the original statement false, we need to find one example of a number which is prime but not solitary.

        <solution>

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            This does not tell you anything about the original implication or its contrapositive (since the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement).  All we can say is that there is a number which is not prime and not solitary.  However, the converse is proved false by this example since there is a number (8) which is both solitary and not prime.

            Assuming that the original statement is true, what can you say about the relationship between the <em>set</em> <m>P</m> of prime numbers and the <em>set</em> <m>S</m> of solitary numbers.  Explain.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We can say that <m>P \subseteq S</m>, since this claims that every element of the set of primes is also an element of the set of solitary numbers.  Thanks to the information that 8 is not solitary, we know that <m>P \ne S</m> so in fact <m>P \subset S</m> is also true.
