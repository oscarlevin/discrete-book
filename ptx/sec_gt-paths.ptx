        An <term>Euler path</term>, in a graph or multigraph,

      If we start at a vertex and trace along edges to get to other vertices,
      we create a <em>walk</em> through the graph.
      More precisely, a <term>walk</term>
      in a graph is a sequence of vertices such that every vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertices before and after it in the sequence.
      If the walk travels along every edge exactly once,
      then the walk is called an <term>Euler path</term>
      (or <term>Euler walk</term>).
      If, in addition, the starting and ending vertices are the same
      (so you trace along every edge exactly once and end up where you started),
      then the walk is called an <term>Euler circuit</term>
      (or <term>Euler tour</term>).
      Of course if a graph is not connected,
      there is no hope of finding such a path or circuit.
      For the rest of this section,
      assume all the graphs discussed are connected.

      The bridges of Königsberg problem is really a question about the existence of Euler paths.

      This graph is small enough that we could actually check every possible walk that does not reuse edges,
      and in doing so convince ourselves that there is no Euler path
      (let alone an Euler circuit).
      On small graphs which do have an Euler path,
      it is usually not difficult to find one.
      Our goal is to find a quick way to check whether a graph has an Euler path or circuit,
      even if the graph is quite large.

    <p permid="GNs">
      One way to guarantee that a graph does <em>not</em>
      have an Euler circuit is to include a
      <q>spike,</q> a vertex of degree 1.

      The vertex <m>a</m> has degree 1, and if you try to make an Euler circuit,
      you see that you will get stuck at the vertex.
      It is a dead end.
      That is, unless you start there.
      But then there is no way to return,
      so there is no hope of finding an Euler circuit.
      There is however an Euler path.
      It starts at the vertex <m>a</m>,
      then loops around the triangle.
      You will end at the vertex of degree 3.
    </p>

    <p permid="TbK">
      You run into a similar problem whenever you have a vertex of any odd degree.
      If you start at such a vertex,
      you will not be able to end there
      (after traversing every edge exactly once).
      After using one edge to leave the starting vertex,
      you will be left with an even number of edges emanating from the vertex.
      Half of these could be used for returning to the vertex,
      the other half for leaving.
      So you return, then leave.
      Return, then leave.
      The only way to use up all the edges is to use the last one by leaving the vertex.
      On the other hand,
      if you have a vertex with odd degree that you do not start a path at,
      then you will eventually get stuck at that vertex.
      The path will use pairs of edges incident to the vertex to arrive and leave again.
      Eventually all but one of these edges will be used up,
      leaving only an edge to arrive by, and none to leave again.
    </p>

    <p permid="ziT">
      What all this says is that if a graph has an Euler path and two vertices with odd degree,
      then the Euler path must start at one of the odd degree vertices and end at the other.
      In such a situation, every other vertex <em>must</em>
      have an even degree since we need an equal number of edges to get to those vertices as to leave them.
      How could we have an Euler circuit?
      The graph could not have any odd degree vertex as an Euler path would have to start there or end there,
      but not both.
      Thus for a graph to have an Euler circuit,
      all vertices must have even degree.
    </p>

    <p permid="fqc">
      The converse is also true:
      if all the vertices of a graph have even degree,
      then the graph has an Euler circuit,
      and if there are exactly two vertices with odd degree,
      the graph has an Euler path.
      To prove this is a little tricky,
      but the basic idea is that you will never get stuck because there is an <q>outbound</q>
      edge for every <q>inbound</q> edge at every vertex.
      If you try to make an Euler path and miss some edges,
      you will always be able to <q>splice in</q>
      a circuit using the edges you previously missed.

    <p permid="DSM">
      It appears that finding Hamilton paths would be easier because graphs often have more edges than vertices,
      so there are fewer requirements to be met.
      However, nobody knows whether this is true.
      There is no known simple test for whether a graph has a Hamilton path.
      For small graphs this is not a problem,
      but as the size of the graph grows,
      it gets harder and harder to check wither there is a Hamilton path.
      In fact, this is an example of a question which as far as we know is too difficult for computers to solve;
      it is an example of a problem which is NP-complete.
