      Stars and bars allows us to count the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 3 kids and natural number solutions to <m>x+y+z = 11</m>,
      for example.
      A relatively easy modification allows us to put a <em>lower bound</em>
      restriction on these problems:
      perhaps each kid must get at least two cookies or <m>x,y,z \ge 2</m>.
      This was done by first assigning each kid
      (or variable)
      2 cookies
      (or units)
      and then distributing the rest using stars and bars.
    </p>

    <p permid="ern">
      <idx><h>distribution (counting)</h><h>with upper bound restriction</h></idx>
      What if we wanted an <em>upper bound</em> restriction?
      For example,
      we might insist that no kid gets more than 4 cookies or that <m>x,
      y, z \le 4</m>.
      It turns out this is considerably harder, but still possible.
      The idea is to count all the distributions and then remove those that violate the condition.
      In other words,
      we must count the number of ways to distribute 11 cookies to 3 kids in which <em>one or more</em>
      of the kids gets more than 4 cookies.
      For any particular kid, this is not a problem;
      we do this using stars and bars.
      But how to combine the number of ways for kid A, or B or C? We must use the PIE.

    <p permid="Kyw">
      The Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion (PIE) gives a method for finding the cardinality of the union of not necessarily disjoint sets.
      We saw in
      <xref ref="sec_counting-addmult"/> how this works with three sets.
      To find how many things are in <em>one or more</em>
      of the sets <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>,
      we should just add up the number of things in each of these sets.
      However, if there is any overlap among the sets,
      those elements are counted multiple times.
      So we subtract the things in each intersection of a pair of sets.
      But doing this removes elements which are in all three sets once too often,
      so we need to add it back in.
      In terms of cardinality of sets, we have
      <me permid="xeL">
        |A \cup B \cup C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A \cap B| - |A \cap C| - |B \cap C| + |A\cap B \cap C|
      </me>.

    <example permid="JAh">
      <statement>
        <p permid="QnI">
          Three kids, Alberto, Bernadette,
          and Carlos, decide to share 11 cookies.
          They wonder how many ways they could split the cookies up provided that none of them receive more than 4 cookies
          (someone receiving no cookies is for some reason acceptable to these kids).

        <p permid="UnH">
          Without the <q>no more than 4</q> restriction,
          the answer would be <m>{13 \choose 2}</m>, using 11 stars and 2 bars
          (separating the three kids).
          Now count the number of ways that one or more of the kids violates the condition,
          i.e., gets at least 4 cookies.
        </p>

        <p permid="AuQ">
          Let <m>A</m> be the set of outcomes in which Alberto gets more than 4 cookies.
          Let <m>B</m> be the set of outcomes in which Bernadette gets more than 4 cookies.
          Let <m>C</m> be the set of outcomes in which Carlos gets more than 4 cookies.
          We then are looking
          (for the sake of subtraction)
          for the size of the set <m>A \cup B \cup C</m>.
          Using PIE, we must find the sizes of <m>|A|</m>,
          <m>|B|</m>, <m>|C|</m>, <m>|A\cap B|</m> and so on.
          Here is what we find.

        <p permid="gBZ">
          <ul permid="DKV">
            <li permid="AQp">
              <m>|A| = {8 \choose 2}</m>.
              First give Alberto 5 cookies,
              then distribute the remaining 6 to the three kids without restrictions,
              using 6 stars and 2 bars.
            </li>

              <m>|B| = {8 \choose 2}</m>.

              <m>|C| = {8 \choose 2}</m>.
              Carlos gets 5 cookies first.

            <li permid="tlQ">
              <m>|A \cap B| = {3 \choose 2}</m>.
              Give Alberto and Bernadette 5 cookies each,
              leaving 1 (star) to distribute to the three kids (2 bars).
            </li>

            <li permid="ZsZ">
              <m>|A \cap C| = {3 \choose 2}</m>.
              Alberto and Carlos get 5 cookies first.

            <li permid="FAi">
              <m>|B \cap C| = {3 \choose 2}</m>.
              Bernadette and Carlos get 5 cookies first.

            <li permid="lHr">
              <m>|A \cap B \cap C| = 0</m>.
              It is not possible for all three kids to get 4 or more cookies.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p permid="MJi">
          Combining all of these we see
          <me permid="dlU">
            |A \cup B \cup C| = {8 \choose 2} + {8 \choose 2} + {8 \choose 2} - {3 \choose 2} - {3 \choose 2} - {3 \choose 2} + 0 = 75
          </me>.
        </p>

        <p permid="sQr">
          Thus the answer to the original question is <m>{13 \choose 2} - 75 = 78 - 75 = 3</m>.
          This makes sense now that we see it.
          The only way to ensure that no kid gets more than 4 cookies is to give two kids 4 cookies and one kid 3;
          there are three choices for which kid that should be.
          We could have found the answer much quicker through this observation,
          but the point of the example is to illustrate that PIE works!

    <p permid="qFF">
      <idx><h>principle of inclusion/exclusion</h><h>for 4 or more sets</h></idx>
      For four or more sets, we do not write down a formula for PIE. Instead,
      we just think of the principle:
      add up all the elements in single sets,
      then subtract out things you counted twice
      (elements in the intersection of a <em>pair</em> of sets),
      then add back in elements you removed too often
      (elements in the intersection of groups of three sets),
      then take back out elements you added back in too often
      (elements in the intersection of groups of four sets),
      then add back in, take back out, add back in, etc.
      This would be very difficult if it wasn't for the fact that in these problems,
      all the cardinalities of the single sets are equal,
      as are all the cardinalities of the intersections of two sets,
      and that of three sets, and so on.
      Thus we can group all of these together and multiply by how many different combinations of 1, 2, 3,
      <ellipsis/> sets there are.

          How many ways can you distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids so that no kid gets more than 2 cookies?

      <solution permid="urj">
        <p permid="YXA">
          There are <m>{13 \choose 3}</m> ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids
          (using 10 stars and 3 bars).
          We will subtract all the outcomes in which a kid gets 3 or more cookies.
          How many outcomes are there like that?
          We can force kid A to eat 3 or more cookies by giving him 3 cookies before we start.
          Doing so reduces the problem to one in which we have 7 cookies to give to 4 kids without any restrictions.
          In that case,
          we have 7 stars (the 7 remaining cookies) and 3 bars
          (one less than the number of kids)
          so we can distribute the cookies in
          <m>{10 \choose 3}</m> ways.
          Of course we could choose any one of the 4 kids to give too many cookies,
          so it would appear that there are
          <m>{4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3}</m> ways to distribute the cookies giving too many to one kid.
          But in fact, we have over counted.

        <p permid="FeJ">
          We must get rid of the outcomes in which two kids have too many cookies.
          There are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> ways to select 2 kids to give extra cookies.
          It takes 6 cookies to do this, leaving only 4 cookies.
          So we have 4 stars and still 3 bars.
          The remaining 4 cookies can thus be distributed in <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> ways
          (for each of the <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices of which 2 kids to over-feed).
        </p>

        <p permid="llS">
          But now we have removed too much.
          We must add back in all the ways to give too many cookies to three kids.
          This uses 9 cookies,
          leaving only 1 to distribute to the 4 kids using stars and bars,
          which can be done in <m>{4 \choose 3}</m> ways.
          We must consider this outcome for every possible choice of which three kids we over-feed,
          and there are <m>{4 \choose 3}</m> ways of selecting that set of 3 kids.
        </p>

        <p permid="Rtb">
          Next we would subtract all the ways to give four kids too many cookies,
          but in this case, that number is 0.
        </p>

        <p permid="xAk">
          All together we get that the number of ways to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids without giving any kid more than 2 cookies is:

            {13 \choose 3} - \left[{4 \choose 1}{10 \choose 3} - {4 \choose 2}{7 \choose 3} + {4\choose 3}{4\choose 3}\right]

        <p permid="dHt">
          This makes sense:
          there is NO way to distribute 10 cookies to 4 kids and make sure that nobody gets more than 2.

          There are <m>4! = 24</m> permutations of 4 elements.
          Now for a permutation to <em>not</em> be a derangement,
          at least one of the 4 elements must be fixed.
          There are <m>{4 \choose 1}</m> choices for which single element we fix.
          Once fixed, we need to find a permutation of the other three elements.
          There are <m>3!</m> permutations on 3 elements.
        </p>
        <p permid="irm">
          But now we have counted too many non-derangements,
          so we must subtract those permutations which fix two elements.
          There are <m>{4 \choose 2}</m> choices for which two elements we fix,
          and then for each pair, <m>2!</m> permutations of the remaining elements.
          But this subtracts too many,
          so add back in permutations which fix 3 elements,
          all <m>{4 \choose 3}1!</m> of them.
          Finally subtract the <m>{4 \choose 4}0!</m> permutations
          (recall <m>0! = 1</m>)
          which fix all four elements.
          All together we get that the number of derangements of 4 elements is:

            4! - \left[{4 \choose 1}3! - {4 \choose 2}2! + {4 \choose 3} 1! - {4 \choose 4}0!\right] = 24 - 15 = 9

      Of course we can use a similar formula to count the derangements of any number of elements.

          So we subtract all the ways in which one or more of the men get their own hat.

      The idea is to count the functions which are

      and then subtract that from the total number of functions.
      This works very well when the codomain has two elements in it:

          There are <m>2^5</m> functions all together,
          two choices for where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.
          Now of these, the functions which are <em>not</em>
          surjective must exclude one or more elements of the codomain from the range.
          So first, consider functions for which <m>a</m> is not in the range.
          This can only happen one way:
          everything gets sent to <m>b</m>.
          Alternatively, we could exclude <m>b</m> from the range.
          Then everything gets sent to <m>a</m>,
          so there is only one function like this.
          These are the only ways in which a function could not be surjective
          (no function excludes both <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> from the range)
          so there are exactly <m>2^5 - 2</m> surjective functions.

    <p permid="zZr">
      When there are three elements in the codomain,
      there are now three choices for a single element to exclude from the range.
      Additionally,

      and we must make sure we don't over count these.

          Again start with the total number of functions:

          Now we count the functions which are
          <em>not</em> surjective.
        </p>

        <p permid="nbf">
          Start by excluding <m>a</m> from the range.
          Then we have two choices (<m>b</m> or <m>c</m>) for where to send each of the five elements of the domain.
          Thus there are <m>2^5</m> functions which exclude <m>a</m> from the range.
          Similarly, there are <m>2^5</m> functions which exclude <m>b</m>,
          and another <m>2^5</m> which exclude <m>c</m>.
          Now have we counted all functions which are not surjective?
          Yes, but in fact, we have counted some multiple times.
          For example,
          the function which sends everything to <m>c</m> was one of the <m>2^5</m> functions we counted when we excluded <m>a</m> from the range,
          and also one of the <m>2^5</m> functions we counted when we excluded <m>b</m> from the range.
          We must subtract out all the functions which specifically exclude two elements from the range.
          There is 1 function when we exclude <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
          (everything goes to <m>c</m>),
          one function when we exclude <m>a</m> and <m>c</m>,

          then subtracted the functions which exclude pairs of elements.
          We would then add back in the functions which exclude groups of three elements,
          except that there are no such functions.
          We find that the number of functions which are

          since each of the <m>2^5</m>'s was the result of choosing 1 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude from the range,
          each of the three <m>1^5</m>'s was the result of choosing 2 of the 3 elements of the codomain to exclude.
          Writing <m>1^5</m> instead of 1 makes sense too:
          we have 1 choice of where to send each of the 5 elements of the domain.

          Now we can finally count the number of surjective functions:

    <p permid="ggA">
      You might worry that to count surjective functions when the codomain is larger than 3 elements would be too tedious.
      We need to use PIE but with more than 3 sets the formula for PIE is very long.
      However, we have lucked out.
      As we saw in the example above,
      the number of functions which exclude a single element from the range is the same no matter which single element is excluded.
      Similarly, the number of functions which exclude a pair of elements will be the same for every pair.
      With larger codomains,
      we will see the same behavior with groups of 3, 4, and more elements excluded.
      So instead of adding/subtracting each of these,
      we can simply add or subtract all of them at once,
      if you know how many there are.
      This works just like it did in for the other types of counting questions in this section,
      only now the size of the various combinations of sets is a number raised to a power,
      as opposed to a binomial coefficient or factorial.

                and for each there were <m>4^5</m> functions.
                But this double counts,
                so we use PIE and subtract functions excluding two elements from the range:
                there are <m>{5 \choose 2}</m> choices for the two elements to exclude,
                and for each pair, <m>3^5</m> functions.
                This takes out too many functions,
                so we add back in functions which exclude 3 elements from the range:
                <m>{5 \choose 3}</m> choices for which three to exclude,
                and then <m>2^5</m> functions for each choice of elements.
                Finally we take back out the 1 function which excludes 4 elements for each of the
                <m>{5 \choose 4}</m> choices of 4 elements.

                If you happen to calculate this number precisely,
                you will get 120 surjections.
                That happens to also be the value of <m>5!</m>.
                This might seem like an amazing coincidence until you realize that every surjective function <m>f:X \to Y</m> with
                <m>\card{X} = \card{Y}</m> finite must necessarily be a bijection.
                The number of bijections is always <m>\card{X}!</m> in this case.
                What we have here is a <em>combinatorial proof</em>
                of the following identity:

                  n^n - \left[{n\choose 1}(n-1)^n - {n \choose 2}(n-2)^n + \cdots + {n \choose n-1}1^n \right] = n!

      We have seen that counting surjective functions is another nice example of the advanced use of the Principle of Inclusion/Exclusion.
      Also, counting injective functions turns out to be equivalent to permutations,
      and counting all functions has a solution akin to those counting problems where order matters but repeats are allowed
      (like counting the number of words you can make from a given set of letters).

    <p permid="suS">
      These are not just a few more examples of the techniques we have developed in this chapter.
      Quite the opposite:
      everything we have learned in this chapter are examples of
      <em>counting functions</em>!
    </p>

    <example permid="ReG">
      <statement>
        <p permid="ZHu">
          How many 5-letter words can you make using the eight letters <m>a</m> through <m>h</m>?
          How many contain no repeated letters?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution permid="rwD">
        <p permid="rKY">
          By now it should be no surprise that there are <m>8^5</m> words,
          and <m>P(8,5)</m> words without repeated letters.
          The new piece here is that we are actually counting functions.
          For the first problem, we are counting all functions from
          <m>\{1,2,\ldots, 5\}</m> to <m>\{a,b,\ldots, h\}</m>.
          The numbers in the domain represent the <em>position</em>
          of the letter in the word,
          the codomain represents the letter that could be assigned to that position.
          If we ask for no repeated letters,
          we are asking for injective functions.
        </p>

        <p permid="XSh">
          If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are <em>any</em>
          sets with <m>|A| = 5</m> and <m>|B| = 8</m>,
          then the number of functions
          <m>f: A \to B</m> is <m>8^5</m> and the number of injections is <m>P(8,5)</m>.
          So if you can represent your counting problem as a function counting problem,
          most of the work is done.

    <example permid="xlP">
      <statement>
        <p permid="FOD">
          How many subsets are there of <m>\{1,2,\ldots, 9\}</m>?
          How many 9-bit strings are there (of any weight)?

      <solution permid="XDM">
        <p permid="DZq">
          We saw in <xref ref="sec_counting-binom"/> that the answer to both these questions is <m>2^9</m>,
          as we can say yes or no (or 0 or 1) to each of the 9 elements in the set
          (positions in the bit-string).
          But <m>2^9</m> also looks like the answer you get from counting functions.
          In fact, if you count all functions
          <m>f: A \to B</m> with <m>|A| = 9</m> and <m>|B| = 2</m>,
          this is exactly what you get.

        <p permid="kgz">
          This makes sense!
          Let <m>A = \{1,2,\ldots, 9\}</m> and <m>B = \{y, n\}</m>.
          We are assigning each element of the set either a yes or a no.
          Or in the language of bit-strings,
          we would take the 9 positions in the bit string as our domain and the set <m>\{0,1\}</m> as the codomain.

      So far we have not used a function as a model for binomial coefficients
      (combinations).
      Think for a moment about the relationship between combinations and permutations,
      say specifically <m>{9 \choose 3}</m> and <m>P(9,3)</m>.
      We <em>do</em> have a function model for <m>P(9,3)</m>.
      This is the number of <em>injective</em>
      functions from a set of size 3 (say <m>\{1,2,3\}</m> to a set of size 9
      (say <m>\{1,2,\ldots, 9\}</m>)
      since there are 9 choices for where to send the first element of the domain,
      then only 8 choices for the second,
      and 7 choices for the third.
      For example, the function might look like this:
      <me permid="jLa">
        f(1) = 5 \qquad f(2) = 8 \qquad f(3) = 4
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="EJk">
      This is a different function from:
      <me permid="PSj">
        f(1) = 4 \qquad f(2) = 5 \qquad f(3) = 8
      </me>.
    </p>

    <p permid="kQt">
      Now <m>P(9,3)</m> counts these as different outcomes correctly,
      but <m>{9\choose 3}</m> will count these
      (among others)
      as just one outcome.
      In fact, in terms of functions
      <m>{9 \choose 3}</m> just counts the number of different ranges possible of injective functions.
      This should not be a surprise since binomial coefficients counts subsets,
      and the range is a possible subset of the codomain.<fn>
      A more mathematically sophisticated interpretation of combinations is that we are defining two injective functions to be <em>equivalent</em>
      if they have the same range,
      and then counting the number of equivalence classes under this notion of equivalence.
      </fn></p>

    <p permid="QXC">
      While it is possible to interpret combinations as functions,
      perhaps the better advice is to instead use combinations
      (or stars and bars)
      when functions are not quite the right way to interpret the counting question.
