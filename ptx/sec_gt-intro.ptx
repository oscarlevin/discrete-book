      Actually, all the graphs we have seen above are just
      <em>drawings</em> of graphs.
      A graph is really an abstract mathematical object consisting of two sets <m>V</m> and <m>E</m> where <m>E</m> is a set of 2-element subsets of <m>V</m>.

  <p permid="oPs">
    Before we start studying graphs,
    we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures
    (dots connected by lines)
    this is fairly ambiguous.
    Do the lines need to be straight?
    Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?
    Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?
    Can one line connect three dots?
  </p>

  <p permid="UWB">
    The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous <em>definitions</em>.
    Crafting good definitions is not easy,
    but it is incredibly important.
    The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed.
    Is there a graph with no edges?
    We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.
  </p>

  <p permid="BdK">
    We want our definition to be precise and unambiguous,
    but it also must agree with our intuition for the objects we are studying.
    It needs to be useful: we <em>could</em>
    define a graph to be a six legged mammal,
    but that would not let us solve any problems about bridges.
    Instead, here is the (now) standard definition of a graph.

  <assemblage permid="Jzh">
    <title>Graph Definition</title>
    <p permid="kfz">
      A <term>graph</term> is an ordered pair
      <m>G = (V, E)</m> consisting of a nonempty set <m>V</m>
      (called the <term>vertices</term>)
      and a set <m>E</m>
      (called the <term>edges</term>)
      of two-element subsets of <m>V</m>.
    </p>
  </assemblage>

  <p permid="hkT">
    Strange.
    Nowhere in the definition is there talk of dots or lines.
    From the definition, a graph could be
    <me permid="MmJ">
      (\{a,b,c,d\}, \{\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\}\})
    </me>.
    Here we have a graph with four vertices 
    (the letters <m>a, b, c, d</m>)
    and four edges (the pairs <m>\{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\})</m>).
  </p>

  <p permid="Nsc">
    Looking at sets and sets of 2-element sets is difficult to process.
    That is why we often draw a representation of these sets.
    We put a dot down for each vertex,
    and connect two dots with a line precisely when those two vertices are one of the 2-element subsets in our set of edges.
    Thus one way to draw the graph described above is this:

    We should be careful about what it means for two graphs to be
    <q>the same.</q> Actually,
    given our definition, this is easy: Are the vertex sets equal?
    Are the edge sets equal?
    We know what it means for sets to be equal,
    and graphs are nothing but a pair of two special sorts of sets.

    </statement>
    <solution permid="ItO">
      <p permid="AtQ">
        No.
        Here the vertex sets of each graph are equal, which is a good start.
        Also, both graphs have two edges.
        In the first graph, we have edges <m>\{a,b\}</m> and <m>\{b,c\}</m>,
        while in the second graph we have edges	<m>\{a,c\}</m> and 	<m>\{c,b\}</m>.
        Now we do have <m>\{b,c\} = \{c,b\}</m>,
        so that is not the problem.
        The issue is that <m>\{a,b\} \ne \{a,c\}</m>.
        Since the edge sets of the two graphs are not equal
        (as sets),
        the graphs are not equal
        (as graphs).

        We can try to build an isomorphism.

        This is definitely a bijection,

        In <m>G_2</m>, <m>f(a) = b</m> and
        <m>f(b) = c</m> are connected by an edge.
        So far, so good, but we must check the other three edges.
        The edge <m>\{a,c\}</m> in <m>G_1</m> corresponds to
        <m>\{f(a),
        f(c)\} = \{b,d\}</m>, but here we have a problem.
        There is no edge between <m>b</m> and <m>d</m> in <m>G_2</m>.
        Thus <m>f</m> is NOT an isomorphism.

        Not all hope is lost, however.
        Just because <m>f</m> is not an isomorphism does not mean that there is no isomorphism at all.

        At this point it might be helpful to draw the graphs to see how they should match up.

        there is also a vertex with this property: <m>c</m>.
        So build the bijection <m>g:V_1 \to V_2</m> by defining <m>g(a) = c</m> to start with.
        Next, where should we send <m>b</m>?
        In <m>G_1</m>,
        the vertex <m>b</m> is only adjacent to vertex <m>a</m>.
        There is exactly one vertex like this in <m>G_2</m>, namely <m>d</m>.
        So let <m>g(b) = d</m>.
        As for the last two, in this example, we have a free choice:

        We should check that this really is an isomorphism.

    Back to some basic graph theory definitions.
    Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once,
    and no vertex is connected to itself.
    Graphs like these are sometimes called <term>simple</term>,
    although we will just call them <em>graphs</em>.
    This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices.
    Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once.
    So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once.
    Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices,
    we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.
  </p>

  <p permid="voy">
    That said, there are times we want to consider double
    (or more)
    edges and single edge loops.
    For example,
    the <q>graph</q> we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore.
    We will call these objects <term>multigraphs</term>.
        <idx><h>multigraph</h></idx>
    This is a good name: a <em>multiset</em>

    The graphs above are also <term>connected</term>
        <idx><h>connected</h></idx>
    : you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges.
    A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together.
    For example,
    the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>:

    Most of the time,
    it makes sense to treat non-connected graphs as separate graphs

  <p permid="nJZ">
    Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them.
    If we add all possible edges,
    then the resulting graph is called <term>complete</term>.
        <idx><h>complete graph</h></idx>
    That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
    Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices,
    there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices.
    We give these a special name: <m>K_n</m>

    <notation>
      <usage>K_n</usage>
      <description>the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices</description>

    is the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices.
  </p>

  <p permid="TRi">
    Each vertex in <m>K_n</m> is adjacent to <m>n-1</m> other vertices.
    We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the
    <term>degree</term> of that vertex.
    So every vertex in <m>K_n</m> has degree <m>n-1</m>.
    How many edges does <m>K_n</m> have?
    One might think the answer should be <m>n(n-1)</m>,
    since we count <m>n-1</m> edges <m>n</m> times
    (once for each vertex).
    However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices,
    so we counted every edge exactly twice.
    Thus there are <m>n(n-1)/2</m> edges in <m>K_n</m>.
    Alternatively, we can say there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> edges,
    since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <m>n</m> vertices.
  </p>

  <p permid="zYr">
    In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph,
    we can find the number of edges.
    The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be
    <em>twice</em> the number of edges,
    since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices.
    Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!

    <solution permid="gWy">
      <p permid="dGt">
        It seems like this should be possible.
        Each mathematician chooses one person to not shake hands with.
        But this cannot happen.
        We are asking whether a graph with 9 vertices can have each vertex have degree 7.
        If such a graph existed,
        the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be <m>9\cdot 7 = 63</m>.
        This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with <m>31.5</m> edges.
        That is impossible.
        Thus at least one
        (in fact an odd number)
