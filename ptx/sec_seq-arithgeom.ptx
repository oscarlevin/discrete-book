    We now turn to the question of finding closed formulas for particular types of sequences.

      If the terms of a sequence differ by a constant,
      we say the sequence is <term>arithmetic</term>.

  </assemblage>

  <p permid="ecS">
    How do we know this?
    For the recursive definition,
    we need to specify <m>a_0</m>.
    Then we need to express <m>a_n</m> in terms of <m>a_{n-1}</m>.
    If we call the first term <m>a</m>, then <m>a_0 = a</m>.
    For the recurrence relation, by the definition of an arithmetic sequence,
    the difference between successive terms is some constant,
    say <m>d</m>.
    So <m>a_n - a_{n-1} = d</m>, or in other words,

      a_0 = a \qquad a_n=a_{n-1}+d

  <p permid="Kkb">
    To find a closed formula, first write out the sequence in general:

            The recursive definition is therefore <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 3</m> with <m>a_0 = 2</m>.

  <p permid="CFC">
    The recursive definition for the geometric sequence with initial term <m>a</m> and common ratio <m>r</m> is

    We can find the closed formula like we did for the arithmetic progression.

    We must multiply the first term <m>a</m> by <m>r</m> a number of times,

            Yes, to get from any term to the next,

    In the examples and formulas above,
    we assumed that the <em>initial</em> term was <m>a_0</m>.
    If your sequence starts with <m>a_1</m>,
    you can easily find the term that would have been <m>a_0</m> and use that in the formula.
    For example, if we want a formula for the sequence
    <m>2, 5, 8,\ldots</m> and insist that <m>2= a_1</m>,
    then we can find <m>a_0 = -1</m>
    (since the sequence is arithmetic with common difference 3, we have <m>a_0 + 3 = a_1</m>).
    Then the closed formula will be <m>a_n = -1 + 3n</m>.
  </p>

  <remark>
    <p permid="OTU">
      If you look at other textbooks or online,
      you might find that their closed formulas for arithmetic and geometric sequences differ from ours.
      Specifically, you might find the formulas
      <m>a_n = a +(n-1)d</m> (arithmetic) and <m>a_n = a\cdot r^{n-1}</m>
      (geometric).
      Which is correct?
      Both!
      In our case, we take <m>a</m> to be <m>a_0</m>.
      If instead we had <m>a_1</m> as our initial term, we would get the
      (slightly more complicated)
      formulas you find elsewhere.

        Incidentally,
        this is exactly the same as <m>{n+1 \choose 2}</m>,
        which makes sense if you think of the triangular numbers as counting the number of handshakes that take place at a party with <m>n+1</m> people:
        the first person shakes <m>n</m> hands,
        the next shakes an additional <m>n-1</m> hands and so on.

        The point of all of this is that some sequences,
        while not arithmetic or geometric,
        can be interpreted as the sequence of partial sums of arithmetic and geometric sequences.
        Luckily there are methods we can use to compute these sums quickly.

            The second term and second-to-last term also add up to 472.

            To find <m>2S</m> then we add 472 to itself a number of times.
            What number?
            We need to decide how many terms (<term>summands</term>) are in the sum.
            Since the terms form an arithmetic sequence,
            the <m>n</m>th term in the sum
            (counting <m>2</m> as the 0th term)
            can be expressed as <m>2 + 3n</m>.
            If <m>2 + 3n = 470</m> then <m>n = 156</m>.
            So <m>n</m> ranges from 0 to 156, giving 157 terms in the sum.

            What have we done?
            We viewed the repeating decimal
            <m>0.464646\ldots</m> as a sum of the geometric sequence
            <m>0.46, 0.0046, 0.000046, \ldots</m> The common ratio is <m>0.01</m>.
            The only real difference is that we are now computing an
            <em>infinite</em> geometric sum,
            we do not have the extra <q>last</q> term to consider.
            Really, this is the result of taking a limit as you would in calculus when you compute
            <em>infinite</em> geometric sums.
