                \end{tabular}

                Notice that there is only one row in which both premises are true
                (row 3).
                In this row, <m>R</m> is also true.
                So whenever the premises are true, so is the conclusion.
                Thus this is a valid deduction rule.

                <m>\neg P \vee \neg Q</m> \amp <m>\neg R</m> \\ \hline
                T \amp T \amp T \amp T \amp F \amp F \\

                F \amp F \amp F \amp T \amp T \amp T \\
                \end{tabular}

                Now look at rows 3. 5 and 7.
                In each of these
                (one would be enough)
                both premises are true.
                However, here the conclusion is false.
                Thus this is NOT a valid deduction rule.
                In fact, we can see exactly where it goes wrong: If <m>P</m> or <m>Q</m> is false and <m>R</m> is true,
                we get a counterexample,
                since <m>Q</m> being false makes both premises true no matter what <m>R</m> is.

            Fifth grade students at a local elementary school took a poll about how they got to school.
            Many students took multiple modes of transportation with 31 students saying they got rides from their parents, 32 taking their bike to school and 21 walking. 8 students who said they bike also walk,
            and 3 students who usually walk get rides from their parents on some mornings.
            The one student that said he uses his bike and gets ride also said he uses all three modes of transportation.

                  How does this problem relate to PIE?
                  <solution>
                    Remember that PIE is the principle of inclusion/exclusion and this problem relates because we want to calculate the total number of students who took the survey but we can't just add up all the numbers in the problem because we would be counting certain students multiple times. So, this means that when we are looking at this problem we need to follow the principle for 3 different sets which gives us:
                    <me>
                      |A\cup B \cup C|=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C| - |B \cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|
                    </me>
                    So, we could have just looked at the problem and related each set of students to each <m>A, B, C</m> where <m>A\cap B</m> is the number of students who did both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> to get to school.

            My circular kitchen table has 4 chairs
            (and we will assume the position of these chairs is important;
            one is facing away from the TV, for example).
            Before our second kid, when we ate dinner,
            my wife and I sat across from each other and our daughter sat in the chair between us on my right
            (the chair to my left was empty).

            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Occasionally,
                  my daughter wanted us to sit in different chairs than usual.
                  For example, she would want to sit in my seat,
                  want me to sit in my wife's seat,
                  and my wife to sit in the chair that is usually empty.
                  How many different seating arrangements are possible?
                  Explain your answer carefully.
                  <solution>
                    There are 4 chairs for my daughter to sit in, then 3 for my wife, and 2 for me. So there are <m>4\cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 24</m> seating arrangements. Note this is simply <m>P(4,3)</m>.

                  When she was feeling especially toddler-like,
                  she would insist that none of us sit in our regular chairs.
                  How many of the seating arrangements you found in the previous part have this property?
                  Explain.
                  <solution>
                    Let's say the normal arrangement of seats is ESMO (empty, Shannon, Maddie, Oscar).  It would not be too difficult to list all of the acceptable seating arrangements here.  In fact, we could list all 24, and cross out any that have one or more people in their usual seats.  Note that it is okay for E to be in the first spot, but S must be in a spot other than the second, M must be in spot other than the third, and O must be in a spot other than the 4th.  This is the list we would be left with:
                    <me>
                      EMOS, EOSM, SEOM, SOEM, SMOE, MEOS, MOES, MOSE, OESM, OMES, OMSE
                    </me>
                    If you wanted to count this using our counting techniques, you could use PIE.  Count the number of <em>unacceptable</em> arrangements and subtract that from 24:
                    <me>
                      24-\left[3\cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 + 3 \cdot 2 - 2 - 2 - 2 + 1\right] = 11
                    </me>.
                    Here each <m>3\cdot 2</m> counts the number of ways that the other two people can sit if one person sits in their usual seat, the 2's count the number of choices for the last person when two people sit in their usual seat, and the 1 is the number of arrangements when all three people sit in their usual seat.

                  Explain each part of your expression and why they are combined the way they are.
                  <solution>
                    There are <m>{2 \choose 1}</m> strings that start with 111 (two spots left, one of which must be a 1), <m>{2 \choose 1}</m> strings that end with 111, and 0 strings that both start and end with 111. Thus all together there are <m>2 + 2 - 0 = 4</m> strings.

                </p>

                <p>
                  Use PIE to count the number of 5-bit strings of weight 4 that contain 111 somewhere in them
                  (which will be at the start,
                  in the middle, at the end or more than one of these).
                  <solution>
                    Start with 111: 2. Have 111 in the middle: 2.  End with 111: 2.  Start with 111 and have 111 in the middle: 1.  Have 111 in the middle and end with 111: 1.  Start and end with 111: 0.  All three: 0.  Thus
                    <me>
                      2 + 2 + 2 - 1 -1 - 0 + 0 = 4
                    </me>

                  Generalize PIE to 4 sets to count the number of 6-bit strings of weight 5 that contain 111 somewhere in them.
                  <solution>
                    Consider the 4 positions the 111 string can occur: (a) first three bits, (b) second three bits, (c) third three bits, and (d) last three bits.  (a) can happen in <m>{3 \choose 2} = 3</m> ways, as can (b), (c), and (d).  What about combinations of two?  (a) and (b): <m>{2 \choose 1}= 2</m>, (a) and (c): 1.  (a) and (d): 0.  (b) and (c): 2.  (b) and (d): 1.  (c) and (d): 2.  Combinations of 3?  (a), (b), and (c) can happen in 1 way, as can (b), (c), and (d), but the other two cannot happen.  Similarly, there is no way for all four to occur.  Putting this together gives:
                    <me>
                      3 +3 +3+3 - 2 -1 - 0 -2 - 1 - 2 + 1+ 1 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 6
                    </me>.
                    This makes sense since all of the 6 length-6-weight-5 bit strings contain 111 somewhere.

            How many 10-digit numbers contain exactly four 1's, three 2's, two 3's and one 4?
            Find the answer in two different ways to establish a binomial identity.
            <solution>
              Some examples of acceptable outcomes: 1111222334, 1212121343, 4332221111, \ldots. Each of these has 10 digits (as the questions states), and the number of each type of digit is the same. It is just the arrangement that matters. So does order matter here? Maybe, but the order of what? The digits?

              How could I break the task of choosing an outcome into subtasks? One way would be to first select what goes in the first digit, then in the second, etc. In this sense order does matter. Does that work? Well there are 4 choices for the first digit. For the second digit there are... well it depends on what I choose for the first digit. So this doesn't work. Let's try something else
            </p>

            <p>
              What if I first select where I put the 4.
              It could go 1st, 2nd, etc.
              There are 10 spots.
              Thus 10, or maybe <m>{10 \choose 1}</m>.
              Now where can I put the 3's.
              It doesn't matter which 3 I place first,
              so here order does not matter.
              I've already filled up one spot with a 4, so there are 9 spots left and I need 2 of them.
              So <m>{9 \choose 2}</m>.
              Ah, then <m>{7 \choose 3}</m> to pick the three spots to put the 2's and
              <m>{4 \choose 4}</m> choices of where to put the four 1's.
              Now do I add or multiply?
              Well to get my 10 digit number I need to do all these subtasks,
              not just one of them, so definitely multiply.
              Thus the answer is
              <me>
                {10 \choose 1}{9 \choose 2}{7 \choose 3}{4 \choose 4} = 12600
              </me>
              Oh wait, what if I picked where the 1's went first?
              There are <m>{10 \choose 4}</m> spots,
              which leaves <m>{6 \choose 3}</m> choices for where to put the 2's, and
              <m>{3 \choose 2}</m> for the 3's and <m>{1 \choose 1}</m> for the 4.
              So now it looks like the answer should be
              <me>
                {10 \choose 4}{6 \choose 3}{3 \choose 2}{1 \choose 1}
              </me>
              Which is it?
              Oh wait, those are the same.
              Yay
            </p>

            <p>
              Let me check one more thing.
              Did I get everything?
              Did I double count?
              Maybe let's try building one of the outcomes using the answer
              (the first one).
              The first thing I do is pick on of 10 things.  10 spots.
              So for example, I could pick this:
              <me>
                - - - - - ~ 4 - - - -
              </me>
              Next I pick 2 out of 9 things.
              Those 9 things are\ldots, the 9 remaining spots.
              What do I do with the 2 that I pick?
              I put in 3's.
              So maybe:
              <me>
                3 - - - - ~ 4 - 3 - -
              </me>
              Yeah, and I was right to use
              <m>{9 \choose 2}</m> instead of <m>P(9,2)</m> because it does not matter if I pick the 1st spot and then the 8th,
              or the 8th and then the 1st.
              Next I choose 3 out of 7\ldots spots to\ldots put 2's into.
              Maybe I get

                  Alternatively,

                  If this is the 4th on your alphabetical list of toppings,

                  Base case: <m>{3 \choose 0} = 1 = {4 \choose 0}</m> when <m>n = 0</m>.

                  Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true.

                  </me>
                  but the left hand side is the same as

                  (each entry in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two entries above it).
                  Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

                    \begin{proof}
                    Proceed by contradiction. Assume <m>G</m> has an Euler circuit and that there are at most 2 vertices sharing the same degree. Since <m>G</m> has an Euler circuit, every vertex has <em>even</em> degree. Thus the possible degrees are 2, 4, and 6 (you cannot have larger degree since there are only 7 vertices). Since there are at most 2 vertices sharing the same degree, there are at most 6 vertices. This contradicts the assumption that <m>G</m> has 7 vertices.

            In any graph, an <em>independent set</em>
            is a subset of the vertices that are not adjacent to each other.
            In other words,
            they are a set of vertices that could be colored the same in a proper vertex coloring.
            Note that the empty set of vertices is independent How many different independent sets are there in <m>P_{10}</m>,
            the path of 10 vertices (9 edges)?
            Hint: this is intended to be a question about sequences.
            You should give a recursive definition for the number of independent sets in <m>P_n</m> and explain why it is correct.
            <solution>
              Start with <m>P_2</m> (a pair of adjacent vertices). There are exactly 3 independent sets: the empty set and the two sets that contain just one vertex. Now for <m>P_3</m>, think of adding in 1 vertex to the end of <m>P_2</m>. We could put this new vertex in the independent set or not. If we keep it out, then each independent set we had before is still independent (so that is 3 already). If we put it in, then we only have 2 choices: put the vertex on the other end in or not. Thus there are a total of 5 independent sets
            </p>

            <p>
              Now the fun begins.
              Add a 4th vertex on the end of the path to get <m>P_4</m>.
              If we keep this vertex out,
              we could use any of the 5 independent sets of <m>P_3</m>.
              If we put it in, then we cannot put the vertex next to it in,
              so we just need to get an independent set on the remaining two vertices.
              But that looks just like <m>P_2</m>,
              and we know there are 3 independent sets.
              So we have <m>8</m> independent sets in <m>P_5</m>
            </p>

            <p>
              It's the Fibonacci recurrence.
              The number of independent sets in <m>P_n</m> is the number in <m>P_{n-1}</m>
              (if we keep the new vertex out)
              plus the number in <m>P_{n-2}</m>
              (if we put the new vertex in).
              Following this up to <m>P_{10}</m> we see there will be 144 independent sets.

                Of these vertices, there will be 6 with degree 2 (the corners), <m>6n-6</m> with degree 4 (the sides) and the rest, <m>3n^2 - 3n</m> with degree 6.  Adding up the degrees and dividing by 2 gives the number of edges: <m>e_n = 9n^2 + 3n</m>.

                Finally, we can use Euler's formula to find the number of triangles.  However, since we don't want to count the outside, we would have

              <p>
                {\bf BONUS:} Clu D. Tector was lecturing on methods for detecting counterfeit coins.
                To illustrate a point he removed four coins from his pocket,
                one of which is either heavier or lighter than the rest
                (in other words, it was counterfeit).
                He then pulled a fifth coin from his pocket and said it was a <q>good</q> coin.
                Next produced a balance scale and challenged the audience to suggest a plan for determining,
                in the fewest possible weighings,
                which of the four original coins was the counterfeit.
                He claimed you could do it in no more than two weighings.
                Describe how you would have to weigh the coins such that you would only have to only weigh the coins twice.
                <solution>
                  First, let's label each of the coins. The first four will be <m>A,B,C,D</m> while the good coin will be <m>G</m>. Let's first measure <m>A,B</m> against <m>C, G</m>. If the scale is balanced then we got lucky and <m>D</m> is the counterfeit coin. Next, weigh <m>D</m> against <m>G</m> to figure out if it is heavy or light. However, it may be the case that that <m>A+B > C+G</m> or <m>A+B < C+G</m>. If the first case is true then <m>D</m> is a good coin, and either <m>C</m> is light or <m>B</m> or <m>A</m> is heavy. Thus, a second weighting of <m>B</m> against <m>A</m> tells which coin is counterfeit. If <m>A=B</m> then <m>C</m> was the counterfeit and was lighter and if <m>A \not=B</m> then whichever one weighed more is the counterfeit and is heavier. Similarly for <m>A+B<C+G</m>. In this case, either <m>C</m> is heavy or <m>A</m> or <m>B</m> is light. Weigh <m>A</m> against <m>B</m> and if they are equivalent then <m>C</m> is heavy. If not, then whichever one weighs less is the counterfeit and is lighter than the rest.

                    The original statement is false.
                    That means that there <em>exists</em>
                    sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> such that
                    <m>|A| = |B|</m> but <m>|A \cup B| \ne 2|A|</m>.
                    We can prove this by giving an example of such sets:
                    <m>A = \{1,2\}</m> and <m>B= \{2,3\}</m>.
                    These sets have the same cardinality,
                    but <m>A \cup B = \{1,2,3\}</m> has cardinality 3, not 4.

                </li>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    The converse is false as well.
                    Take <m>A = \{1,2\}</m> and <m>B = \{2,3,4\}</m>.
                    Now we have <m>|A \cup B| = 4 = 2|A|</m> but <m>|A| = 2</m> and <m>|B| = 3</m>.
                  </p>

                <li>
                  <p>
                    The new statement is about specific sets.
                    For these sets, <m>|A| \ne |B|</m>,
                    so the hypothesis of the implication is false.
                    That makes the entire statement true automatically
                    (even though the conclusion is false).
                    This one example does not prove that the original implication is true
                    (after all, it is not).
                    It also cannot prove that the original statement is false,
                    as it is not a counterexample.

          and you must answer 6 of them.
          In how many different ways could you complete the exam?
          There are actually two reasonable answers to this question.
          Give both of them and explain what the difference is and how they are related.
          Your explanation should include a justification for why the larger answer is larger and by how much.

          One answer is <m>{10 \choose 6}</m>,

          These are different, in fact,
          <m>P(10,6)</m> is <m>6!</m> times larger than <m>{10 \choose 6}</m>.
          This is because <m>{10 \choose 6}</m> is the number of ways to select which 6 of the 10 questions you will answer,
          but then assumes you will answer them in the usual order.
          Once you have selected the 6 questions,
          you could answer them (possibly) out of order in 6! different ways,
          and that is what <m>P(10,6)</m> counts: There are 10 choices for which question to answer first, 9 for which to answer second,
          and so on until you have answered 6 questions.

                We just need to choose 1 item not to order.
                Or equivalently, <m>{4 \choose 3} = 4</m>.
                Notice that we are giving these in alphabetical order,

          How many lattice paths traveling only up and right,

          Answer this question in two ways.
          What pattern in Pascal's triangle is this an example of?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Each step in our path adds 1 to either <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>.
          So to end at a point on <m>x+y = 5</m>,
          we must make <m>5</m> steps, each being in the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> direction.
          Thus all together there are <m>2^5</m> such paths.

          Answering this another way,
          notice that these paths end at <m>(0,5)</m>, <m>(1,4)</m>,
          <m>(2, 3)</m>, <m>(3,2)</m>, <m>(4,1)</m>, or <m>(5,0)</m>.
          Counting the paths to each of these points separately,
          we get <m>{5 \choose 0}</m>,
          <m>{5 \choose 1}</m>, <m>{5 \choose 2}</m>, \ldots, <m>{5 \choose 5}</m>
          (each time choosing which of the <m>n</m> steps are in the <m>x</m> direction).

          This might remind you a little about the anagrams questions,
          so you could use as a question:
          how many <m>n</m> -letter words can you make using <m>k</m> a's, <m>j</m> b's and the rest of the letters c's?
          One answer is to pick <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> spots to fill with a's
          (in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways),
          then chose <m>j</m> of the remaining <m>n-k</m> spots to fill with b's, and fill the remaining spots with c's.
          Answer 2 is to first pick the spots where the b's go:
          pick <m>j</m> of the <m>n</m> spots to fill with b's, then pick <m>k</m> of the remaining <m>n-j</m> spots to fill with a's, and fill the remaining spots with c's.

          Another question you could ask:
          how many ways are there to select a <m>k</m> -person team and a <m>j</m> -person team from a group of <m>n</m> people.
          The two answers depend on which team you pick first.

          How many ways can you do this?
          On one hand,
          you can choose <m>k</m> of the <m>n</m> bow ties to give away in <m>{n \choose k}</m> ways.
          Alternatively, you can choose which bow ties to keep.
          You must keep <m>n -k</m> of them if you will give <m>k</m> away,

                Note that a strictly increasing function is automatically injective.
                So the five outputs must all be different.
                So let's first pick which five outputs we will use:
                there are <m>{10 \choose 5}</m> ways to do this.
                Now how many ways are there to assign those outputs to the inputs <m>1</m> through 5?
                Only one way,
                since there is only one way to arrange numbers in increasing order.

            <li>
              <p>
                <m>{14 \choose 5}</m>.
                This is in fact a stars and bars problem.
                The stars are the 5 inputs and the bars are the 9 spots between the 10 possible outputs.
                Think of it this way - we will specify <m>f(1)</m>,
                then <m>f(2)</m>, then <m>f(3)</m>, and so on in that order.
                Start with the possible output 0.
                We can use it as the output of <m>f(1)</m>,
                or we can switch to 1 as a potential output.
                Say we put <m>f(1) = 1</m>.
                Now we are at 1
                (can't go back to 0).
                Should <m>f(2) = 1</m>?
                If yes, then we are putting down another star.
                If no, put down a bar and switch to 2.
                Maybe you switch to 3, then assign <m>f(2) = 3</m> and <m>f(3) = 3</m>
                (two more stars)
                before switching to 4 as a possible output.
                And so on.

          you can choose from 2520 different meals.
          One of your friends says that this is too small
          (that it should be 16807),

        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Everyone is right, under different interpretations.
          The 2520 number is correct if you assume that customers will pick 5 different items,
          but care about what order they eat them in
          (so eating a taco and then a burrito would be a different meal than eating a burrito then a taco).
          Then the answer would be <m>P(7,5) = 7\cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4</m>.
          If we care about the order we eat the items in but allow repeated items,
          we get <m>7^5 = 16807</m>.
          If we just want to count the number of 5-item meals,
          with 5 distinct items, we get <m>{7 \choose 5} = 21</m>.
          Another reasonable answer would be to count the number of 5-item meals,
          not distinguishing between different orders of consumption,
          but allowing for repeated items.
          This would be a stars-and-bars problem,
          giving <m>{11 \choose 5}</m> meals.

          To thank your math professor for doing such an amazing job all semester,
          you decide to bake him
          (or her)
          cookies.
          You know how to make 10 different types of cookies.

                To keep things interesting,
                you decide to make a different number of each type of cookie.
                If again you want to select 4 cookie types,
                how many ways can you select the cookie types and decide for which there will be the most,
                second most, etc.
                Explain your answer.

            <li>
              <p>
                You change your mind again.
                This time you decide you will make a total of 12 cookies.
                Each cookie could be any one of the 10 types of cookies you know how to bake
                (and it's okay if you leave some types out).
                How many choices do you have?

                You realize that the previous plan did not account for presentation.
                This time, you once again want to make 12 cookies,
                each one could be any one of the 10 types of cookies.
                However, now you plan to shape the cookies into the numerals 1, 2, \ldots, 12
                (and probably arrange them to make a giant clock - but you haven't decided on that yet).

                You need to choose 4 of the 10 cookie types.
                Order doesn't matter. %If you want to give your professor 4 different types of cookies,

                <m>P(10, 4) = 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7</m>.
                You are choosing and arranging 4 out of 10 cookies.
                Order matters now. %To keep things interesting,
                you decide to make a different number of each type of cookie.

                You must switch between cookie type 9 times as you make your 12 cookies.
                The cookies are the stars,
                the switches between cookie types are the bars. %You change your mind again.

          For which of the parts above does it make sense to interpret the counting question as counting some number of functions?
          Say what the domain and codomain should be,
          and whether you are counting all functions, injections,
          surjections, or something else.
        </p>
      </statement>

        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                You are giving your professor 4 types of cookies coming from 10 different types of cookies.
                This does not lend itself well to a function interpretation.
                We {\em could} say that the domain contains the 4 types you will give your professor and the codomain contains the 10 you can choose from,
                but then counting injections would be too much
                (it doesn't matter if you pick type 3 first and type 2 second,
                or the other way around, just that you pick those two types).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                We want to consider injective functions from the set
                <m>\{\mbox{most, second most,
                second least, least}\}</m> to the set of 10 cookie types.
                We want injections because we cannot pick the same type of cookie to give most and least of
                (for example).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                This is not a good problem to interpret as a function.
                The problem is that the domain would have to be the 12 cookies you bake,
                but these elements are indistinguishable
                (there is not a first cookie, second cookie, etc.).
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>
                The domain should be the 12 shapes,
                the codomain the 10 types of cookies.
                Since we can use the same type for different shapes,
                we are interested in counting all functions here.
                Note that if we insisted that each type of cookie be given at least once,
                this would be asking for the number of surjections,
                which would require using PIE.

                  <q>at the end of day <m>n</m>,
                  you have an odd number of beans.</q> For the base case,
                  not that on day 0, you have 5 beans, which is odd.
                  Now assume that <m>P(k)</m> is true.
                  That is, at the end of the <m>k</m> th day,
                  you have an odd number of beans.
                  What happens on the next day?
                  We triple the number of beans, and subtract 6.
                  If you triple an odd number, you will get an odd number.
                  Then subtracting 6
                  (an even number)
                  will still give you an odd number.
                  Thus the number of beans at the end of day <m>k+1</m> will be odd.
                  This concludes the inductive case.
                  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
                  <m>P(n)</m> is true of all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

                  The inductive case works independent of the base case.
                  We can prove the IF you have an odd number of beans on day <m>k</m>, THEN you have an odd number of beans on day <m>k+1</m>.
                  But to go from this to the conclusion that you will always have an odd number of beans requires a starting spot.
                  In fact, if you started with 4 beans,
                  then the next day you would have 6 beans, and then 12, and so on.
                  All these numbers would be even!

                  Hint: <m>(n+1)^{n+1} > (n+1) \cdot n^{n}</m>.
                  \begin{proof}
                  Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>n! < n^n</m>.
                  We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
                  For the base case,
                  note that <m>2! = 2</m> while <m>2^2 = 4</m>, so <m>P(2)</m> is true.
                  For the inductive case,
                  assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 2</m>.
                  That is, <m>k! < k^k</m>.
                  Consider <m>(k+1)! = (k+1)k!</m>.
                  This is less than <m>(k+1)k^k</m> and <m>k^k</m> is less than <m>(k+1)^k</m>.
                  That is,
                  \begin{align*}
                  (k+1)! \amp = (k+1)k! \\
                  \amp < (k+1)k^k \\
                  \amp < (k+1)(k+1)^k \\
                  \amp = (k+1)^{k+1}
                  \end{align*}
                  Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true as well.
                  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
                  \end{proof}

              <li>
                <p>
                  \begin{proof}
                  Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement <m>\d\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} +\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{n\cdot(n+1)} = \d\frac{n}{n+1}</m>.
                  We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
                  For the base case, we have
                  <m>\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} = \frac{1}{1+1}</m>, so <m>P(1)</m> is true.

                  For the inductive case,
                  assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
                  That is, <m>\d\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} +\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{k\cdot(k+1)} = \d\frac{k}{k+1}</m>.
                  Consider what happens when we add the next fraction,
                  namely <m>\frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)}</m> to both sides:
                  <me>
                    \d\frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{2\cdot 3} +\frac{1}{3\cdot 4}+\cdots + \frac{1}{k\cdot(k+1)} + \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \d\frac{k}{k+1} + \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)}
                  </me>
                  The right hand side becomes
                  <me>
                    \frac{k(k+2)}{(k+1)(k+2)} + \frac{1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{k^2 + 2k + 1}{(k+1)(k+2)} = \frac{k+1}{k+2}
                  </me>
                  Thus <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.
                  Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
                  <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

                  Hint: Write <m>4^{k+1} - 1 = 4\cdot 4^k - 4 + 3</m>.

                  \begin{proof}
                  Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement
                  <q> <m>4^n-1</m> is a multiple of 3.</q>
                  We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

                  Base case: <m>4^0 -1 = 0</m> which is a multiple of 3, so <m>P(0)</m> is true.

                  Inductive case: Assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 0</m>.
                  That is, <m>4^k - 1</m> is a multiple of 3.
                  Consider <m>4^{k+1} - 1</m>.
                  We can write this as <m>4\cdot 4^k - 4 + 3</m>,
                  or equivalently <m>4(4^k - 1) + 3</m>.
                  Since <m>4^k-1</m> is a multiple of 3
                  (by the inductive hypothesis),
                  <m>4</m> times it is a multiple of 3, and adding 3 will still give a multiple of 3.
                  Thus <m>4^{k+1} - 1</m> is a multiple of 3, so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

                  Therefore by the principle of mathematical induction <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 0</m>.

                  Careful to actually use induction here.
                  The base case: <m>2^2 = 4</m>.
                  The inductive case:
                  assume <m>(2n)^2</m> is divisible by 4 and consider <m>(2n+2)^2 = (2n)^2 + 4n + 4</m>.
                  This is divisible by 4 because <m>4n +4</m> clearly is,
                  and by our inductive hypothesis, so is <m>(2n)^2</m>.

            By the definition of generating functions,

        <statement>
          <p>
            Prove, using strong induction,
            that every positive integer can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2.
            For example, <m>13 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Note that <m>1 = 2^0</m> -- this is your base case.
            Now suppose <m>k</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>1\le k \le n</m>.
            We can then write <m>n</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2 as follows:
            subtract the largest power of 2 less than <m>n</m> from <m>n</m>.
            That is, write <m>n = 2^j + k</m> for the largest possible <m>j</m>.
            But <m>k</m> is now less than <m>n</m>,
            and also less than <m>2^j</m>,
            so write <m>k</m> as the sum of distinct powers of 2
            (we can do so by the inductive hypothesis).
            Thus <m>n</m> can be written as the sum of distinct powers of 2 for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            Prove using induction that every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets for any <m>n \ge 1</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
            <q>every set containing <m>n</m> elements has <m>2^n</m> different subsets.</q>
            We will show <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.

            \underline{Base case}: Any set with 1 element <m>\{a\}</m> has exactly 2 subsets:
            the empty set and the set itself.
            Thus the number of subsets is <m>2= 2^1</m>.
            Thus <m>P(1)</m> is true.

            \underline{Inductive case}: Suppose <m>P(k)</m> is true for some arbitrary <m>k \ge 1</m>.
            Thus every set containing exactly <m>k</m> elements has <m>2^k</m> different subsets.
            Now consider a set containing <m>k+1</m> elements:
            <m>A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k, a_{k+1}\}</m>.
            Any subset of <m>A</m> must either contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> or not.
            In other words, a subset of <m>A</m> is just a subset of
            <m>\{a_1, a_2,\ldots,
            a_k\}</m> with or without <m>a_{k+1}</m>.
            Thus there are <m>2^k</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which contain <m>a_{k+1}</m> and another <m>2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m> which do not contain <m>a^{k+1}</m>.
            This gives a total of <m>2^k + 2^k = 2\cdot 2^k = 2^{k+1}</m> subsets of <m>A</m>.
            But our choice of <m>A</m> was arbitrary,
            so this works for any subset containing <m>k+1</m> elements,
            so <m>P(k+1)</m> is true.

            Therefore, by the principle of mathematical induction,
            <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 1</m>.
