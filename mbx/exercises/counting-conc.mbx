            You have 9 presents to give to your 4 kids. How many ways can this be done if:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The presents are identical, and each kid gets at least one present?
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The presents are identical, and some kids might get no presents?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                The presents are unique, and some kids might get no presents?

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li><m>{8 \choose 3}</m> ways, after giving one present to each kid, you are left with 5 presents (stars) which need to be divide among the 4 kids (giving 3 bars).</li>
              <li><m>{12 \choose 3}</m> ways. You have 9 stars and 3 bars.</li>
              <li><m>4^9</m>. You have 4 choices for whom to give each present. This is like making a function from the set of presents to the set of kids.</li>
              <li><m>4^9 - \left[{4 \choose 1}3^9 - {4\choose 2}2^9 + {4 \choose 3}1^9 \right]</m> ways. Now the function from the set of presents to the set of kids must be surjective.</li>

                  Neither. If all the kids were identical, and you wanted no empty teams, it would be <m>{10 \choose 4}</m>. Instead, this will be the same as the number of surjective functions from a set of size 11 to a set of size 5.

            For which of the parts of the previous problem (<xref ref="exr_cookie-counting"/>) does it make sense to interpret the counting question as counting some number of functions? Say what the domain and codomain should be, and whether you are counting all functions, injections, surjections, or something else.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                You are giving your professor 4 types of cookies coming from 10 different types of cookies. This does not lend itself well to a function interpretation. We <em>could</em> say that the domain contains the 4 types you will give your professor and the codomain contains the 10 you can choose from, but then counting injections would be too much (it doesn't matter if you pick type 3 first and type 2 second, or the other way around, just that you pick those two types).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We want to consider injective functions from the set <m>\{</m>most, second most, second least, least<m>\}</m> to the set of 10 cookie types. We want injections because we cannot pick the same type of cookie to give most and least of (for example).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                This is not a good problem to interpret as a function. The problem is that the domain would have to be the 12 cookies you bake, but these elements are indistinguishable (there is not a first cookie, second cookie, etc.).

                The domain should be the 12 shapes, the codomain the 10 types of cookies. Since we can use the same type for different shapes, we are interested in counting all functions here.

            <li>
              <p>
                Here we insist that each type of cookie be given at least once, so now we are asking for the number of surjections of those functions counted in the previous part.
