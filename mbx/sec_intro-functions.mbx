  <title>Functions</title>


  <introduction>
    <p>
      A
      <term>function</term><idx><h>function</h></idx> is a rule that assigns each input exactly one output.  We call the output the <term>image</term> of the input.  The set of all inputs for a function is called the
      <term>domain</term><idx><h>domain</h></idx>. The set of all allowable outputs is called the
      <term>codomain</term><idx><h>codomain</h></idx>. We would write <m>f:X \to Y</m> to describe a function with name <m>f</m>, domain <m>X</m> and codomain <m>Y</m>. This does not tell us <em>which</em> function <m>f</m> is though. To define the function, we must describe the rule. This is often done by giving a formula to compute the output for any input (although this is certainly not the only way to describe the rule). </p>

    <p> For example, consider the function <m>f:\N \to \N</m> defined by <m>f(x) = x^2 + 3</m>. Here the domain and codomain are the same set (the natural numbers). The rule is: take your input, multiply it by itself and add 3. This works because we can apply this rule to every natural number (every element of the domain) and the result is always a natural number (an element of the codomain). Notice though that not every natural number actually is an output (there is no way to get 0, 1, 2, 5, etc.). The set of natural numbers that are <em>actually outputs</em> is called the
      <term>range</term><idx><h>range</h></idx> of the function (in this case, the range is <m>\{3, 4, 7, 12, 19, 28, \ldots\}</m>, all the natural numbers that are 3 more than a perfect square).
    </p>

    <p>
      The key thing that makes a rule actually a <em>function</em> is that there is <em>exactly one</em> output for each input. That is, it is important that the rule be a good rule. What output do we assign to the input 7? There can only be one answer for any particular function.
    </p>

    <p>
      The description of the rule can vary greatly. We might just give a list of the images of each input. You could also describe the function with a table or a graph or in words.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The following are all examples of functions:

          <ol>
            <li><m>f:\Z \to \Z</m> defined by <m>f(n) = 3n</m>. The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is only the set of integer multiples of 3.</li>
            <li><m>g: \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b,c\}</m> defined by <m>g(1) = c</m>, <m>g(2) = a</m> and <m>g(3) = a</m>. The domain is the set <m>\{1,2,3\}</m>, the codomain is the set <m>\{a,b,c\}</m> and the range is the set <m>\{a,c\}</m>. Note that <m>g(2)</m> and <m>g(3)</m> are the same element of the codomain. This is okay since each element in the domain still has only one output.</li>
            <li>
              <m>h:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}</m> defined as follows:

                  <image xml:id="arrow-function-example">
                    <latex-image>
                      \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.85]
              \draw[-&gt;] (-1,1) node[above] {1} -- (0,0) node[below] {2};
              \draw[-&gt;] (0,1) node[above] {2} -- (-1,0) node[below] {1};
              \draw[-&gt;] (1,1) node[above] {3} -- (1,0) node[below] {3};
            \end{tikzpicture}
                    </latex-image>
                  </image>
                </sidebyside>
                This means that the function <m>f</m> sends 1 to 2, 2 to 1 and 3 to 3: just follow the arrows.

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      The arrow diagram used to define the function above can be very helpful in visualizing functions. We will often be working with functions with <em>finite</em> domains, so this kind of picture is often more useful than a traditional graph of a function. A graph of the function in example 3 above would look like this:
    </p>
    <sidebyside width="40%">
      <image xml:id="discrete-function-graph">
        <latex-image>
          \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.75]
      \draw[thin, gray!50] (0,0) grid (3.5, 3.5);
      \draw[-&gt;, thick] (0,0) -- (0,3.5);
     \draw[-&gt;, thick] (0,0) -- (3.5,0);
     \fill (1,2) circle (3pt) (2,1) circle (3pt) (3,3) circle (3pt);
    \end{tikzpicture}
        </latex-image>
      </image>
    </sidebyside>
    <p>
      It would be absolutely WRONG to connect the dots or try to fit them to some curve. There are only three elements in the domain. A curve suggests that the domain contains an entire interval of real numbers. Remember, we are not in calculus any more!
    </p>

    <p>
      Since we will so often use functions with small domains and codomains, let's adopt some notation that is a little easier to work with than that of examples 2 and 3 above. All we need is some clear way of denoting the image of each element in the domain. In fact, writing a table of values would work perfectly:

      <sidebyside>
        <tabular>
          <row bottom="minor">
            <cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>x</m></cell>
            <cell>0</cell>
            <cell>1</cell>
            <cell>2</cell>
            <cell>3</cell>
            <cell>4</cell>
          </row>
          <row>
            <cell right="minor" halign="center"><m>f(x)</m></cell>
            <cell>3</cell>
            <cell>3</cell>
            <cell>2</cell>
            <cell>4</cell>
            <cell>1</cell>
          </row>
        </tabular>
      </sidebyside>
    </p>
    <p>
      We simplify this further by writing this as a matrix with each input directly over its output:
      <me>
        f = \begin{pmatrix}0 \amp 1 \amp 2\amp 3 \amp 4 \\ 3 \amp 3 \amp 2 \amp 4 \amp 1\end{pmatrix}
      </me>
      Note this is just notation and not the same sort of matrix you would find in a linear algebra class (it does not make sense to do operations with these matrices, or row reduce them, for example).
    </p>


    <p>
      It is important to know how to determine if a rule is or is not a function. Drawing the arrow diagrams can help.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Which of the following diagrams represent a function? Let <m>X = \{1,2,3,4\}</m> and <m>Y = \{a,b,c,d\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <m>f</m> is a function. So is <m>g</m>. There is no problem with an element of the codomain not being the image of any input, and there is no problem with <m>a</m> from the codomain being the image of both 2 and 3 from the domain. We could use our two-line notation to write these as
          <me>
            f= \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp c \amp b \end{pmatrix} \qquad g = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ d \amp a \amp a \amp b \end{pmatrix}.
          </me>

        </p>

        <p>
          However, <m>h</m> is <u>not</u> a function. In fact, it fails for two reasons. First, the element 1 from the domain has not been mapped to any element from the codomain. Second, the element 2 from the domain has been mapped to more than one element from the codomain (<m>a</m> and <m>c</m>). Note that either one of these problems is enough to make a rule not a function. In general, neither of the following mappings are functions:

        <p>
          It might also be helpful to think about how you would write the two-line notation for <m>h</m>. We would have something like:
          <me>
            h=\begin{pmatrix} 1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ \amp a,c? \amp d \amp b\end{pmatrix}.
          </me>
          There is nothing under 1 (bad) and we needed to put more than one thing under 2 (very bad). With a rule that is actually a function, the two-line notation will always <q>work</q>.

      We now turn to investigating special properties functions might or might not possess.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the examples above, you may have noticed that sometimes there are elements of the codomain which are not in the range. When this sort of the thing <em>does not</em> happen, (that is, when everything in the codomain is in the range) we say the function is
      <term>onto</term><idx><h>onto</h></idx> or that the function maps the domain <em>onto</em> the codomain. This terminology should make sense: the function puts the domain (entirely) on top of the codomain. The fancy math term for an onto function is a
      <term>surjection</term><idx><h>surjection</h></idx>, and we say that an onto function is a
      <term>surjective</term> function.

      To be a function, a rule cannot assign a single element of the domain to two or more different elements of the codomain. However, we have seen that the reverse <em>is</em> permissible: a function might assign the same element of the codomain to two or more different elements of the domain. When this <em>does not</em> occur (that is, when each element of the codomain is the image of at most one element of the domain) then we say the function is
      <term>one-to-one</term><idx><h>one-to-one</h></idx>. Again, this terminology makes sense: we are sending at most one element from the domain to one element from the codomain. One input to one output. The fancy math term for a one-to-one function is an
      <term>injection</term><idx><h>injection</h></idx>. We call one-to-one functions
      <term>injective</term> functions.

      From the examples above, it should be clear that there are functions which are surjective, injective, both, or neither. In the case when a function is both one-to-one and onto (an injection and surjection), we say the function is a

    <title>Inverse Image</title>
    <p>
      When discussing functions, we have notation for talking about an element of the domain (say <m>x</m>) and its corresponding element in the codomain (we write <m>f(x)</m>, which <em>is</em> the image of <m>x</m>). It would also be nice to start with some element of the codomain (say <m>y</m>) and talk about which element or elements (if any) from the domain it is the image of. We could write <q>those <m>x</m> in the domain such that <m>f(x) = y</m>,</q> but this is a lot of writing. Here is some notation to make our lives easier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose <m>f:X \to Y</m> is a function. For <m>y \in Y</m> (an element of the codomain), we write
      <m>f\inv(y)</m><notation><usage>f\inv(y)</usage><description>the complete inverse image of <m>y</m> under <m>f</m>.</description></notation> to represent the <em>set</em> of all elements in the domain <m>X</m> which get sent to <m>y</m>. That is, <m>f\inv(y) = \{x \in X \st f(x) = y\}</m>. We say that <m>f\inv(y)</m> is the
      <term>complete inverse image</term><idx><h>inverse image</h></idx> of <m>y</m> under <m>f</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>WARNING: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is not an inverse function! Inverse functions only exist for bijections, but <m>f\inv(y)</m> is defined for any function <m>f</m>. The point: <m>f\inv(y)</m> is a <em>set</em>, not an <em>element</em> of the domain.</b>
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>f:\{1,2,3,4,5,6\} \to \{a,b,c,d\}</m> given by
          <me>
            f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \amp 6 \\ a \amp a \amp b \amp c \amp c \amp c\end{pmatrix}.
          </me>
          Find the complete inverse image of each element in the codomain.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Remember, we are looking for sets.
          <me>
            f\inv(a) = \{1,2\}
          </me>
        </p>
        <me>
          f\inv(b) = \{3\}
        </me>
        <me>
          f\inv(c) = \{4,5,6\}
        </me>
        <me>
          f\inv(d) = \emptyset.
        </me>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider the function <m>g:\Z \to \Z</m> defined by <m>g(n) = n^2 + 1</m>. Find <m>g\inv(1)</m>, <m>g\inv(2)</m>, <m>g\inv(3)</m> and <m>g\inv(10)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          To find <m>g\inv(1)</m>, we need to find all integers <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 + 1 = 1</m>. Clearly only 0 works, so <m>g\inv(1) = \{0\}</m> (note that even though there is only one element, we still write it as a set with one element in it).
        </p>

        <p>
          To find <m>g\inv(2)</m>, we need to find all <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 + 1 = 2</m>. We see <m>g\inv(2) = \{-1,1\}</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          If <m>n^2 + 1 = 3</m>, then we are looking for an <m>n</m> such that <m>n^2 = 2</m>. There are no such integers so <m>g\inv(3) = \emptyset</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, <m>g\inv(10) = \{-3, 3\}</m> because <m>g(-3) = 10</m> and <m>g(3) = 10</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Since <m>f\inv(y)</m> is a set, it makes sense to ask for <m>\card{f\inv(y)}</m>, the number of elements in the domain which map to <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find a function <m>f:\{1,2,3,4,5\} \to \N</m> such that <m>\card{f\inv(7)} = 5</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There is only one such function. We need five elements of the domain to map to the number <m>7 \in \N</m>. Since there are only five elements in the domain, all of them must map to 7. So
          <me>
            f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \amp 5 \\ 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7 \amp 7\end{pmatrix}.
          </me>
        </p>
      </solution>

            <p>
              A
              <term>function</term> is a rule that assigns each element of a set, called the

              <term>codomain</term>.

          <li>
            <p>
              Notation: <m>f:X \to Y</m> is our way of saying that the function is called <m>f</m>, the domain is the set <m>X</m>, and the codomain is the set <m>Y</m>.

          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use
              <term>two-line notation</term> by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input, as in:
              <me>
                f = \begin{pmatrix}1 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 4 \\ 2 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 1 \end{pmatrix}.
              </me>

          </li>

          <li>
            <p><m>f(x) = y</m> means the element <m>x</m> of the domain (input) is assigned to the element <m>y</m> of the codomain. We say <m>y</m> is an output. Alternatively, we call <m>y</m> the
              <term>image of <m>x</m> under <m>f</m></term>.</p>

            <p>
              The
              <term>range</term> is a subset of the codomain. It is the set of all elements which are assigned to at least one element of the domain by the function. That is, the range is the set of all outputs.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              A function is

              <term>at most</term> one element from the domain.

            <p>
              A

              <term>exactly one</term> element of the domain.
            </p>
          </li>


          <li><p>
            The <term>image</term> of an element <m>x</m> in the domain is the element <m>y</m> in the codomain that <m>x</m> is mapped to.  That is, the image of <m>x</m> under <m>f</m> is  <m>f(x)</m>.
